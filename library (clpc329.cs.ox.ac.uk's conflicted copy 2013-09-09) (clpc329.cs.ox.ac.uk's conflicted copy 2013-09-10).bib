abstract = {This study presents a method for the reduction of biophysically-based kinetic models for the active transport of ions. A lumping scheme is presented which exploits the differences in timescales associated with fast and slow transitions between model states, while maintaining the thermodynamic properties of the model. The goal of this approach is to contribute to modelling of the effects of disturbances to metabolism, associated with ischaemic heart disease, on cardiac cell function. The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of L\"{a}uger and Apell, Eur. Biophys. J. 13 (1986) 309, for which the principles of free energy transduction are used to link the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis (deltaGATP) to the transition rates between states of the model. An iterative minimisation algorithm is implemented to determine the transition rate parameters based on the model fit to experimental data. Finally, the relationship between deltaGATP and pump cycling direction is investigated and compared with recent experimental findings.},

abstract = {Regulation of the Na/K ATPase by protein kinases is model-specific. We have observed a profound activation of the sarcolemmal Na/K ATPase during cardiac ischemia, which is masked by an inhibitor of the enzyme in the cytosol. The aim of these studies was to characterize the pathways involved in this activation in the Langendorff-perfused rat heart. Na/K ATPase activity was determined by measuring ouabain-sensitive phosphate generation by cardiac homogenates at 37 degrees C. In isolated sarcolemma, ischemia (30 min) caused a substantial activation of the Na/K ATPase compared with aerobic controls, which was abolished by perfusing the heart with staurosporine or H89. However, the alpha1 subunit of the Na/K ATPase was not phosphorylated during ischemia. The sarcolemmal protein phospholemman (PLM) was found associated with the Na/K ATPase alpha1 and beta1 but not alpha2 subunits, and PLM increased its association with the catalytic subunit of PKA following ischemia. In vitro 14-3-3 binding assays indicated that PLM was phosphorylated following ischemia. These results indicate that the ischemia-induced activation of the Na/K ATPase is indirect, through phosphorylation of PLM, which is an integral part of the Na/K ATPase enzyme complex in the heart. The role of PLM is analogous to phospholamban in regulating the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that breakdown of the excitation-contraction coupling system plays a pivotal role in myocardial dysfunction during the course of acute ischemia. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum at pH 7.1 and 6.4 after 7.5, 15, and 30 minutes of canine normothermic global ischemia. At pH 7.1, whole heart homogenate sarcoplasmic reticulum demonstrated a 49\% depression of oxalate-supported calcium uptake at 7.5 minutes of ischemia, which progressed to 85\% at 30 minutes of ischemia. At pH 6.4, control homogenate calcium uptake rates were significantly depressed, accompanied by a further depression in the ischemic groups. Isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake mirrored the effects of the whole heart homogenate. Calcium-stimulated magnesium-dependent ATPase (calcium-ATPase) activity was significantly depressed by both ischemia and acidosis, with a decrease in the coupling ratio (mumol calcium/mumol ATP) at 15 and 30 minutes of ischemia. Acidosis (pH 6.4) significantly shifted the sarcoplasmic reticulum pCalcium-ATPase curve to the right, increasing 50\% activation from pCalcium 6.0 to 5.5 and depressing the maximum velocity (pH 7.1 = 2.06 +/- 0.14; pH 6.4 = 1.41 +/- 0.05 mumol Pi/mg per min; P less than 0.01). With ischemia, there was a progressive decrease in maximal activation of the calcium-ATPase enzyme and a progressive shift in calcium sensitivity to a higher concentration. Steady state calcium uptake, in the absence of oxalate, demonstrated a similar depression after 7.5 and 15 minutes of ischemia at pH 7.1 and 6.4, associated with a significant increase in the passive permeability coefficient for calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange (NCX) is crucial in the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) and cardiac contractility, but key details of its dynamic function during the heartbeat are not known. In the present study, we assess how NCX current (I(NCX)) varies during a rabbit ventricular action potential (AP). First, we measured the steady-state voltage and [Ca(2+)](i) dependence of I(NCX) under conditions when [Ca(2+)](i) was heavily buffered. We then used this relationship to infer the submembrane [Ca(2+)](i) ([Ca(2+)](sm)) sensed by NCX during a normal AP and [Ca(2+)](i) transient (when the AP was interrupted to produce an I(NCX) tail current). The [Ca(2+)](i) dependence of I(NCX) at -90 mV allowed us to convert the peak inward I(NCX) tail currents to [Ca(2+)](sm). Peak [Ca(2+)](sm) measured via this technique was >3.2 micromol/L within < 32 ms of the AP upstroke (versus peak [Ca(2+)](i) of 1.1 micromol/L at 81 ms measured with the global Ca(2+) indicator indo-1). The voltage and [Ca(2+)](sm) dependence of I(NCX) allowed us to infer I(NCX) during the normal AP and Ca(2+) transient. The early rise in [Ca(2+)](sm) causes I(NCX) to be inward for the majority of the AP. Thus, little Ca(2+) influx via NCX is expected under physiological conditions, but this can differ among species and in pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {1. We recorded cardiac sodium-calcium exchange current (INa-Ca) in giant excised membrane patches obtained from cardiac myocytes of the adult guinea-pig. 2. Rapid changes in ion concentrations on the cytoplasmic side of the excised membrane patch were produced using a modified oil-gate bath. 3. Sodium-calcium exchange current was activated by step increases in sodium concentration on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane ([Na+]i), which led to an increase in outward INa-Ca to a new steady-state level. The [Na+]i required to half-maximally activate the sodium-calcium exchange current (K1/2) was 21 mM. 4. Step increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) stimulated the [Na+]i-activated INa-Ca up to 1 microM [Ca2+]i, then inhibited the exchange current at very high [Ca2+]i (1 mM). 5. A step decrease in cytoplasmic pH from 7.2 to 6.4 (increase in [H+]i) produced a biphasic but monotonic decrease in INa-Ca. Alkalinization of cytoplasmic pH from 7.2 to 8.0 caused a large, biphasic increase in INa-Ca. 6. When INa-Ca was activated by a step increase in [Na+]i and [H+]i was simultaneously increased, the outward current rose to a peak and then declined to a low steady level. The peak current seen was always less than the maximum current produced by an identical elevation of [Na+]i at constant pHi. This reduction in peak outward current reflected a rapid 'primary' inhibition of the sodium-calcium exchange by protons. The decay of the sodium-calcium exchange current following the peak was slow and corresponded to the time course of the onset of a 'secondary' proton block. 7. Rapid primary inhibition of the sodium-calcium exchanger could also be produced by cytoplasmic acidification in the absence of cytoplasmic sodium. The primary blockade was revealed when a subsequent increase in [Na+]i activated INa-Ca and a smaller peak outward current was observed. Secondary inhibition of the sodium-calcium exchanger was not, however, produced by cytoplasmic acidification in the absence of cytoplasmic sodium. Regardless of the duration of exposure to elevated [H+]i, the 'secondary' block by protons was still seen on activation of INa-Ca by increased [Na+]i as a gradual reduction of outward current amplitude. 8. Treatment of the sodium-calcium exchanger with the proteolytic enzyme alpha-chymotrypsin largely removed its sensitivity to protons. 9. We conclude that the action of alpha-chymotrypsin on the monomeric sodium-calcium exchange protein is in part to remove a proton-sensitive regulatory component(s) or render the regulation ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The cellular basis of cardiac pacemaking is still debated. Reliable computational models of the sinoatrial node (SAN) action potential (AP) may help gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Recently, novel models incorporating detailed Ca(2+)-handling dynamics have been proposed, but they fail to reproduce a number of experimental data, and more specifically effects of 'funny' (I(f)) current modifications. We therefore developed a SAN AP model, based on available experimental data, in an attempt to reproduce physiological and pharmacological heart rate modulation. Cell compartmentalization and intracellular Ca(2+)-handling mechanisms were formulated as in the Maltsev-Lakatta model, focusing on Ca(2+)-cycling processes. Membrane current equations were revised on the basis of published experimental data. Modifications of the formulation of currents/pumps/exchangers to simulate I(f) blockers, autonomic modulators and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms (ivabradine, caesium, acetylcholine, isoprenaline, BAPTA) were derived from experimental data. The model generates AP waveforms typical of rabbit SAN cells, whose parameters fall within the experimental ranges: 352 ms cycle length, 80 mV AP amplitude, -58 mV maximum diastolic potential (MDP), 108 ms APD(50), and 7.1 Vs(-1) maximum upstroke velocity. Rate modulation by I(f) -blocking drugs agrees with experimental findings: 20\% and 22\% caesium-induced (5mM) and ivabradine-induced (3 $\mu$M) rate reductions, respectively, due to changes in diastolic depolarization (DD) slope, with no changes in either MDP or take-off potential (TOP). The model consistently reproduces the effects of autonomic modulation: 20\% rate decrease with 10 nM acetylcholine and 28\%increase with 1 $\mu$M isoprenaline, again entirely due to increase in the DD slope,with no changes in either MDP or TOP. Model testing of BAPTA effects showed slowing of rate, -26\%, without cessation of beating. Our up-to-date model describes satisfactorily experimental data concerning autonomic stimulation, funny-channel blockade and inhibition of the Ca(2+)-related system by BAPTA, making it a useful tool for further investigation. Simulation results suggest that a detailed description of the intracellular Ca(2+) fluxes is fully compatible with the observation that I(f) is a major component of pacemaking and rate modulation.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death due to the development of lethal arrhythmias is the dominant cause of mortality in the UK, yet the mechanisms underlying their onset, maintenance and termination are still poorly understood. Therefore biomarkers are used to determine arrhythmic risk within patients and of new drug compounds. In recent years, the magnitude of variations in the length of successive beats,measured over a short period of time, has been shown to be a powerful pre- dictor of arrhythmic risk. This beat-to-beat variability is thought to be the manifestation of the random opening and closing dynamics of individual ion channels that lie within the membrane of cardiac cells. Computational models have become an important tool in understanding the electrophysiology of the heart. However, current state-of-the-art electrophysiology models do not incorporate this intrinsic stochastic behaviour of ion channels. Those that do use compu- tationally costly methods, restricting their use in complex tissue scale simulations, or employ stochastic simulationmethods that result in negative numbers of channels and so are inaccurate. Therefore, using current stochasticmodelling techniques to investigate the role of stochastic ion channel behaviour in beat-to-beat variability presents difficulties. In this thesis we take a mathematically rigorous and novel approach to develop accurate and computationally efficient models of stochastic ion channel dynamics that can be incorporated into existing electrophysiology models. Two different models of stochastic ion channel be- haviour, both based on a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), are developed and compared. The first model is based on an existing SDEmodel from population dynamics called theWright-Fishermodel. The second approach incorporates boundary conditions into the SDE model of ion channel dynamics that is obtained in the limit fromthe discrete-stateMarkov chain model, and is called a reflected SDE. Of these twomethods, the reflected SDE is found tomore accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the discrete-stateMarkov chain, seen as the ‘gold- standard’ model and also provides substantial computational speed up. Thus the reflected SDE is an accurate and efficient model of stochastic ion channel dynamics and so allows for detailed investigation into beat-to-beat variability using complex computational electrophysiologymod- els. We illustrate the potential power of this method by incorporating it into a state-of-the-art canine cardiac cell electrophsyiology model so as to explore the effects of stochastic ion chan- nel behaviour on beat-to-beat variability. The stochastic models presented in this thesis fulfil an important role in elucidating the effects of stochastic ion channel behaviour on beat-to-beat variability, a potentially important biomarker of arrhythmic risk.},

abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

The Chaste project evolved from the Integrative Biology (IB) e-Science Project, an inter-institutional project aimed at developing a suitable IT infrastructure to support physiome-level computational modelling, with a primary focus on cardiac and cancer modelling.

abstract = {Experimental action potential (AP) recordings in isolated ventricular myoctes display significant temporal beat-to-beat variability in morphology and duration. Furthermore, significant cell-to-cell differences in AP also exist even for isolated cells originating from the same region of the same heart. However, current mathematical models of ventricular AP fail to replicate the temporal and cell-to-cell variability in AP observed experimentally. In this study, we propose a novel mathematical framework for the development of phenomenological AP models capable of capturing cell-to-cell and temporal variabilty in cardiac APs. A novel stochastic phenomenological model of the AP is developed, based on the deterministic Bueno-Orovio/Fentonmodel. Experimental recordings of AP are fit to the model to produce AP models of individual cells from the apex and the base of the guinea-pig ventricles. Our results show that the phenomenological model is able to capture the considerable differences in AP recorded from isolated cells originating from the location. We demonstrate the closeness of fit to the available experimental data which may be achieved using a phenomenological model, and also demonstrate the ability of the stochastic form of the model to capture the observed beat-to-beat variablity in action potential duration.},

abstract = {The force-frequency relationship has intrigued researchers since its discovery by Bowditch in 1871. Many attempts have been made to construct mathematical descriptions of this phenomenon, beginning with the simple formulation of Koch-Wesser and Blinks in 1963 to the most sophisticated ones of today. This property of cardiac muscle is amplified by $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation, and, in a coordinated way, the neurohumoral state alters both frequency (acting on the sinoatrial node) as well as force generation (modifying ventricular myocytes). This synchronized tuning is needed to meet new metabolic demands. Cardiac modelers have already linked mechanical and electrical activity in their formulations and showed how those activities feedback on each other. However, now it is necessary to include neurological control to have a complete description of heart performance, especially when changes in frequency are involved. Study of arrhythmias (or antiarrhythmic drugs) based on mathematical models should incorporate this effect to make useful predictions or point out potential pharmaceutical targets.},

abstract = {Although the dog is the principal species used for in vivo studies of atrial arrhythmias, little is known about currents governing canine atrial repolarization. Cells were isolated from dog atria by exposure to collagenase of tissue in vitro ("chunk cells") and by arterial perfusion ("perfusion cells"). Whole cell voltage clamp revealed transient outward K+ current (Ito1), Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current (Ito2), and delayed rectifier K+ current (IK). Ito1 recovered rapidly and showed little frequency dependence. Two components of IK were present as follows: a rapidly activating E-4031-sensitive current with marked inward recitification and a slower-activating E-4031-insensitive component. Ito1 and IK resembled corresponding currents previously described in human atrium. Transient outward currents were similar in chunk and perfusion cells, but IK was seen in 4\% of chunk cells vs. 99\% of perfusion cells (P < 0.001). Suppression of each identified current retarded canine action potential repolarization. We conclude that Ito1, Ito2, and both components of IK are present in dog atrium, IK is much more sensitive to the isolation method than Ito1 or Ito2, and the properties of two important repolarizing currents (Ito1 and IK) previously described in human atrium are similar to those in dog atrium.},

abstract = {Experimental studies of pro-arrhythmic mechanisms are scarcely performed in humans due to the limited availability of human cardiomyocytes. Subsequently, extrapolation of animal experimental research to humans is widely extended. Our aim is to systematically compare the ionic mechanisms of the main cellular biomarkers of arrhythmic risk between human and rabbit using computer simulations. For this purpose four stimulation protocols were applied to the Mahajan et al. rabbit ventricular action potential (AP) model for control conditions and for ± 15 and ± 30\% variations in the ionic current conductances of the main repolarization currents to quantify cellular biomarkers. Sensitivity of every simulated biomarker to every parameter modification was compared to that obtained for human in our previous work. Our results show that the ionic mechanisms involved in AP triangulation, systolic intracellular calcium concentration and AP duration (APD) accommodation to abrupt changes of pacing rate are very similar in both species. Unfortunately, significant differences were found in the ionic mechanisms related to APD, restitution properties and rate dependence of intracellular calcium and sodium concentrations. In conclusion, extrapolation of experimental research in rabbit to humans is limited by the existence of species dependent ionic mechanisms. In addition, this analysis is very useful for understanding and improvement of mathematical models.},

abstract = {The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr))-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90\% repolarization (APD(90)) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity ($\delta$V) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD(90) and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I(Kr) density in the intact tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but $\delta$V was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.},

abstract = {Calcium release units (CRUs) are constituted of specialized junctional domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) that bear calcium release channels, also called ryanodine receptors (RyRs). In cardiac muscle, CRUs come in three subtypes that differ in geometry, but have common molecular components. Peripheral couplings are formed by a junction of the jSR with the plasmalemma; dyads occur where the jSR is associated with transverse (T)-tubules; corbular SR is a jSR domain that is located within the cells and bears RyRs but does not associate with either plasmalemma or T-tubules. Using transmission electron microscopy, this study followed the formation of CRUs and their accrual of four components: the L-type channel dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) of plasmalemma/T-tubules; the RyRs of jSR; triadin (Tr) and junctin (JnC), two homologous components of the jSR membrane; and calsequestrin (CSQ), the internal calcium binding proteins. During differentiation, peripheral couplings are formed first and the others follow. RyRs and DHPRs are targeted to subdomains of the CRUs that face each other and are acquired in a concerted manner. Overexpressions of either junction (JnC or Tr) and of CSQ, singly or in conjunction, shed light on the specific role of JnC in the structural development, organization, and maintenance of jSR cisternae and on the independent synthetic pathways and targeting of JnC and CSQ. In addition, the structural cues provided by the overexpression models allow us to define sequential steps in the synthetic pathway for JnC and CSQ and their targeting to the CRUs of differentiating myocardium.},

abstract = {Electrical excitation of cardiac muscle may sometimes be due to initiation of inward current by the presence of Ca2+ ions at the inner surface of the cell membrane. During digitalis toxicity and other conditions that abnormally augment cellular Ca2+ stores, premature release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to a transient inward current, which is large enough to initiate premature beats and is accompanied by a transient contractile response. This inward current may be mediated either by electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange or by specific Ca2+-activated cation channels that have recently been characterized in tissue cultures of cardiac myocytes. An obvious question raised by these observations is whether release of the sequestered Ca2+ stores during each normal beat exerts a similar influence on membrane potential. To explore this, chick embryonic myocardial cell aggregates were voltage-clamped during abrupt exposure to caffeine, which is known to release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The speed of the perfusion system and the relative absence of diffusion barriers in the tissue-cultured cells allowed the effects of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release to be studied on a time scale comparable to that of a single normal beat. We report here that abrupt exposure of the cells to caffeine produced a transient inward current having similar features to that of digitalis toxicity, and which was both large enough and rapid enough to potentially contribute to the action potential.},

abstract = {Ventricular arrhythmias occurring consequent to regional disturbances of myocardial perfusion are the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. They are related to marked changes of impulse propagation in the ischemic region, which consist of circulating excitation with re-entry. Mapping of the impulse during ventricular tachycardias and ventricular fibrillation shows that the circus movements change their shape and localization from beat to beat. Zones of tissue which block the impulse during one beat may conduct the impulse at a fast rate during the next beat. The main cause underlying this behavior is the depression of the ischemic action potential. This depression is caused by the partial inactivation and the prolonged recovery of the rapid sodium inward current. In addition to the decrease in resting potential, other factors, such as acidosis, contribute to the inactivation of the inward currents generating the upstroke of the action potential. An increase of coupling resistance between myocardial cells and/or an increase of extracellular resistance appear to be less important for explaining conduction disturbances in acute ischemia.},

Most common treatment algorithms still involve small molecule drugs, and antiarrhythmic agents with improved efficacy and safety are sorely needed. This paper reviews the model systems that are available for discovery and development of new antiarrhythmic drugs. We begin with a presentation of screening methods used to identify specific channel-interacting agents, with a particular emphasis on high-throughput screens. Traditional manual electrophysiological methods, automated electrophysiology, fluorescent dye methods, flux assays and radioligand binding assays are reviewed. We then discuss a variety of relevant arrhythmia models. Two models are widely used in testing for arrhythmogenic actions related to excess action potential prolongation, an important potential adverse effect of chemical entities affecting cardiac rhythm: the methoxamine-sensitized rabbit and the dog with chronic atrioventricular block. We then go on to review models used to assess potential antiarrhythmic actions. For ventricular arrhythmias, chemical induction methods, cardiac or neural electrical stimulation, ischaemic heart models and models of cardiac channelopathies can be used to identify effective antiarrhythmic agents. For atrial arrhythmias, potentially useful models include vagally-maintained atrial fibrillation, acute asphyxia with atrial burst-pacing, sterile pericarditis, Y-shaped atria surgical incisions, chronic atrial dilation models, atrial electrical remodelling due to sustained atrial tachycardia, heart failure-related atrial remodelling, and acute atrial ischaemia. It is hoped that the new technologies now available and the recently-developed models for arrhythmia-response assessment will permit the introduction of newer and more effective antiarrhythmic therapies in the near future.},

abstract = {Arrhythmogenic action potential alternans (APD-ALT) is thought to arise from beat to beat alteration in cellular Ca(2+) cycling. Previously, we found that spatial heterogeneity in APD-ALT between ventricular myocytes is key to the mechanism linking APD-ALT to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. However, the cellular and molecular basis for APD-ALT is poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneities in expression and function of calcium cycling proteins underlies heterogeneities in APD-ALT, endocardial and epicardial myocytes were isolated from left ventricular free wall of 20 guinea pig hearts. APD-ALT and Ca(2+) transient alternans (Ca-ALT) were measured simultaneously as stimulus rate was increased progressively. Endocardial myocytes exhibited greater susceptibility to cellular alternans than epicardial myocytes as evidenced by a significantly lower pacing rate threshold for APD-ALT (113 +/ -9 bpm vs. 151 +/- 8 bpm, respectively, P < 0.05) and for Ca-ALT (110 +/- 8 bpm vs. 149 +/- 8 bpm, respectively, P < 0.05). APD-ALT never occurred without Ca-ALT, whereas Ca-ALT was readily induced in the absence of APD-ALT by repetitive constant action potential waveform, suggesting that Ca-ALT was not secondary to APD-ALT. Importantly, there were significant voltage-independent differences in Ca(2+) cycling between endocardial and epicardial myocytes as evidenced by weaker Ca(2+) release (32\% lower Ca(2+) amplitude, and 16\% longer rise time), and slower Ca(2+) reuptake (24\% larger Ca(2+) decay time constant, and 9\% longer Ca(2+) transient duration) in endocardial compared to epicardial myocytes. Taken together these data indicate that myocytes that are most susceptible to APD-ALT exhibit impaired Ca(2+) release and reuptake. Moreover, transmural differences in Ca(2+) cycling function was associated with significantly reduced endocardial expression of ryanodine release channel (by 22\%) and SERCA2 (by 40\%), suggesting a potential molecular basis for spatially heterogeneous APD-ALT. Moreover, transmural differences in expression and function of key SR Ca(2+) cycling proteins may underlie spatial heterogeneity of APD-ALT that has been closely linked to cardiac arrhythmogenesis.},

abstract = {The control of intracellular calcium is central to regulation of contractile force in cardiac muscle. This review illustrates how analysis of the control of calcium requires an integrated approach in which several systems are considered. Thus, the calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a major determinant of the amount of Ca(2+) released from the SR and the amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient. The amplitude of the transient, in turn, controls Ca(2+) fluxes across the sarcolemma and thence SR content. This control of SR content influences the response to maneuvers that modify, for example, the properties of the SR Ca(2+) release channel or ryanodine receptor. Specifically, modulation of the open probability of the ryanodine receptor produces only transient effects on the Ca(2+) transient as a result of changes of SR content. These interactions between various Ca(2+) fluxes are modified by the Ca(2+) buffering properties of the cell. Finally, we predict that, under some conditions, the above interactions can result in instability (such as alternans) rather than ordered control of contractility.},

abstract = {Oxygen-derived free radicals have been reported to damage the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, potentially contributing to cellular Ca2+ overload and myocardial damage after ischemia and reperfusion. To determine whether the ATP binding site on Ca(2+)-ATPase is involved in oxygen radical injury, SR vesicles containing bound Ca(2+)-ATPase were isolated from rabbit cardiac and skeletal muscle and exposed to a hydroxyl radical (.OH)-generating system consisting of H2O2 and Fe(3+)-nitrilotriacetic acid in amounts that generate a magnitude of .OH similar to that which occurs in the reperfused heart. .OH exposure completely inhibited Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and SR 45Ca uptake for both cardiac and skeletal muscle. In contrast, when the purified vesicles were premixed with 1 mmol/L ATP before exposure to .OH, complete protection was observed: there was no loss of ATPase activity or 45Ca transport. No significant protection occurred with adenosine, sucrose, AMP, or ADP (1 mmol/L each). SDS-gel electrophoresis indicated that .OH did not damage the primary structure of the enzyme. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping experiments demonstrated that ATP did not scavenge .OH. These results suggest that .OH denatures the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase by directly attacking the ATP binding site, and occupation of the active site by ATP protects against .OH-induced loss of enzymatic activity and SR Ca2+ transport. The depletion of ATP that occurs during ischemia may enhance the toxic effect of .OH at the time of reperfusion.},

abstract = {An animal experimental model which stimulates human effort angina, especially in terms of diastolic abnormalities, was developed using isovolumically beating perfused rat hearts. Using this model, we studied the effects of nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on diastolic properties during pacing-induced ischemia. When the preload of the left ventricle was set at a low level, low-flow ischemia (coronary perfusion pressure of 40 mmHg) plus tachycardia (480 beats/min for 4 min) did not induce an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). However, with a high preload, low-flow ischemia plus pacing tachycardia induced an increase in LVEDP of 8.4 +/- 5.4 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and a prolongation of the time constant of ventricular pressure decline (6.8 +/- 4.6 msec, p less than 0.05) immediately after pacing tachycardia. Pretreatment with nifedipine (3 x 10(-8) M) prevented the rise in LVEDP induced by pacing tachycardia. Thus, in isolated perfused hearts, diastolic abnormalities similar to those seen in angina pectoris were obtained by low-flow ischemia plus pacing tachycardia. The response to nifedipine suggested that an alteration of Ca2+ movement may play an important role in the increase in left ventricular stiffness under these conditions.},

Comparison of the single-channel first latency distribution and the time course of the ensemble average current showed that the activation time course and its voltage dependence are largely determined by the transitions before first opening. The open dwell time data are consistent with a single kinetically distinguishable open state. Once the channel opens, it can enter at least two closed states which are not traversed frequently during the activation process. The rate constants for the transitions among these closed states and the open state are nearly voltage-independent at depolarized voltages (> -30 mV). During the deactivation process at more negative voltages, the channel can close directly to a closed state in the activation pathway in a voltage-dependent fashion.},

abstract = {The membrane currents of single ventricular cells were measured under whole cell voltage clamp using a giga-sealed patch electrode, and the effects of intracellular acidification were examined by perfusing the electrode pipette with different pH solutions. The plateau of the action potential was shortened when the pH of the pipette solution was lowered from the control of 7.2 to 6, and finally to 5. The pH 6 pipette solution evoked a time-independent outward current at positive potentials and increased the slope conductance near the resting potential. These changes were suppressed by removal of both intra- and extracellular potassium ion, indicating that these currents were carried by potassium ions, but not by protons. Increasing the calcium concentration in the pipette from pCa 8 to pCa 6 induced a time-dependent outward current which had a reversal potential of about -13 mV. This result clearly differed from the changes induced by the acidic pipette solution, suggesting that the calcium-mediated conductance was not involved in the genesis of the acidic effects. The calcium current was not significantly affected by perfusion at pH 6, but was decreased by the more acidic (pH 5) solution. When the calcium current was recorded in sodium- and potassium-free external solution but with a cesium-rich internal solution, however, the calcium current was suppressed even with a weak acidic (pH 6.8) pipette solution. This effect was attributed not to an increased sensitivity of the calcium channel to protons, but to a more extensive intracellular acidification, which might have been caused by a depressed extrusion of proton via a sodium-hydrogen exchange mechanism on the surface membrane.},

abstract = {1. The contribution of ATP-sensitive K+ (K+ATP) channels to the rapid increase in cellular K+ efflux and shortening of action potential duration (APD) during early myocardial ischaemia and hypoxia remains controversial, because for the first 10 min of ischaemia or hypoxia in intact hearts cytosolic [ATP] remains about two orders of magnitude greater than the [ATP] causing half-maximal blockade of K+ATP channels in excised membrane patches. The purpose of this study was to investigate this apparent discrepancy. 2. During substrate-free hypoxia, total, diastolic and systolic unidirectional K+ efflux rates increased by 43, 26 and 103\% respectively after 8.3 min in isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa loaded with 42K+. APD shortened by 39\%. From the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, the relative increases in systolic and diastolic K+ efflux rates were consistent with activation of a voltage-independent K+ conductance. 3. During total global ischaemia, [K+]o measured with intramyocardial valinomycin K(+)-sensitive electrodes increased at a maximal rate of 0.68 mM min-1, which could be explained by a less than 26\% increase in unidirectional K+ efflux rate (assuming no change in K+ influx), less than the increase during hypoxia. APD shortened by 23\% over 10 min. 4. During hypoxia and ischaemia, cytosolic [ATP] decreased by about one-third from 6.8 +/- 0.5 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 and 4.6 +/- 0.4 mM respectively, and free cytosolic [ADP] increased from 15 to 95 and approximately 63 microM respectively. 5. To estimate the percentage of activation of current through K+ATP channels (IK,ATP) necessary to double the systolic K+ efflux rate (comparable to the increase during hypoxia), K+ efflux during a single simulated action potential was measured by blocking non-K+ currents under control conditions and after IK,ATP was fully activated by metabolic inhibitors. Activation of 0.41 +/- 0.07\% of maximal IK,ATP was sufficient to double the systolic K+ efflux rate. The equivalent amount of constant hyperpolarizing current also shortened the APD in the isolated myocytes by 41 +/- 5\%, compared to the 39\% APD shortening observed during hypoxia in the intact heart. 6. The degree of activation of IK,ATP expected to occur during hypoxia and ischaemia was estimated by characterizing the ATP sensitivity of K+ATP channels in the presence of 2 mM-free Mgi2+ and 0, 10, 100 and 300 microM-ADPi in inside-out membrane patches excised from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The normal expression of Ca2+-handling protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that beta-blocker treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca2+-handling protein

METHODS: We investigated the change of LV remodeling and function in a rat model of heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without carvedilol (30 mg/kg/d) or metoprolol (60 mg/kg/d) treatment for 6 weeks (n = 9 in the MI plus carvedilol group, and n = 8 in every other group). The expression of messenger RNA and proteins of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA) and phospholamban in cardiomyocytes of all rats were also measured

RESULTS: There was significant LV remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in MI rats. The messenger RNA and protein expression of SERCA were down-regulated (p < 0.01), but the expression of phospholamban messenger RNA and protein were up-regulated (p < 0.01) in MI rats compared to sham-operated rats. After the treatment with beta-blockers, LV remodeling and function were clearly improved. Carvedilol was better in attenuating the weight of the LV and the relative weight of the right ventricle than metoprolol (p < 0.05). beta-Blockers restored the low expression of SERCA (p < 0.05) but showed no effect on phospholamban expression (p > 0.05). Moreover, carvedilol induced a more significant improvement of SERCA expression than metoprolol (p < 0.05)

CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers are effective in preventing LV remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA expression.},

abstract = {We examine the problem of parameter estimation in mathematical models of excitable cell cardiac electrical activity using the well-known Beeler-Reuter (1977) ionic equations for the ventricular action potential. The estimation problem can be regarded as equivalent to the accurate reconstruction of ionic current kinetics and amplitudes in an excitable cell model, given only action potential experimental data. We show that in the Beeler-Reuter case, all ionic currents may be reasonably reconstructed using an experimental design consisting of action potential recordings perturbed by pseudo-random injection currents. The Beeler-Reuter model was parameterised into 63 parameters completely defining all membrane current amplitudes and kinetics. Total membrane current was fitted to model-generated experimental data using a 'data-clamp' protocol. The experimental data consisted of a default action-potential waveform and an optional series of perturbed waveforms generated by current injections. Local parameter identifiability was ascertained from the reciprocal condition value (1/lambda) of the Hessian at the known solution. When fitting to a single action potential waveform, the model was found to be over-determined, having a 1/lambda value of approximately 3.6e-14. This value improved slightly to approximately 1.4e-10 when an additional 2 perturbed waveforms were included in the fitting process, suggesting that the additional data did not overly improve the identifiability problem. The additional data, however, did allow the accurate reconstruction of all ionic currents. This indicates that by appropriate experimental design, it may be possible to infer the properties of underlying membrane currents from observation of transmembrane potential waveforms perturbed by pseudo-random currents.},

abstract = {The effect of heart rate on extracellular [K+] ([K+]o) accumulation during total global ischemia was investigated in the isolated arterially perfused (37 degrees C) rabbit interventricular septum using intramyocardial K+-sensitive electrodes (tip diameter, 0.3 mm) and intracellular microelectrodes. The heart rates tested were 0, 25, 75, 125, and 150 beats/min in aqueous-perfused septa and 25, 75, and 125 beats/min in blood-perfused septa. In the lower range of heart rates (0-75 beats/min) the rate and magnitude of [K+]o accumulation during 10 min of ischemia were markedly rate dependent, but in the higher range of rates (75-150 beats/min) the rate dependence was markedly attenuated in both aqueous and blood-perfused preparations. The latter finding could be largely attributed to the more rapid shortening of the action potential duration during ischemia at the higher rates and demonstrates that the amount of time the myocardium spends in the depolarized state is an important determinant of the rate of cellular K+ loss during ischemia. Progressive shortening of the action potential duration during ischemia is also a major factor determining the onset of the plateau phase of [K+]o accumulation. The findings help to resolve previous conflicting reports on the effects of heart rate on [K+]o accumulation during ischemia.},

abstract = {Two characteristic features of the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier current (IKr) are prominent inward rectification and an unexpected reduction in activating current with decreased [K+]o. Similar features are observed with heterologous expression of HERG, the gene thought to encode the channel carrying IKr, moreover, recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying rectification of HERG current is the inactivation that channels rapidly undergo during depolarizing pulses. The present studies were designed to determine the mechanism of IKr rectification and [K+]o sensitivity in the mouse atrial myocyte cell line, AT-1 cells. Reducing [Mg2+]i to 0, which reverses inward rectification of some K+ channels, did not alter IKr current-voltage relationships, although it did decrease sensitivity to the IKr blockers dofetilide and quinidine 2- to 5-fold. To determine the presence and extent of fast inactivation of IKr in AT-1 cells, a brief hyperpolarizing pulse (20 ms to -120 mV) was applied during long depolarizations. Immediately after this pulse, a very large outward current that decayed rapidly to the previous activating current baseline was observed. This outward current component was blocked by the IKr-specific inhibitor dofetilide, indicating that it represented recovery from fast inactivation during the hyperpolarizing step, with fast reinactivation during the return to depolarized potential. With removal of inactivation using this approach, current-voltage relationships for IKr ([K+]o, 1 to 20 mmol/L) were linar and reversed close to the predicted Nernst potential for K+. In addition, decreased [K+]o decreased the time constants for open-->inactivated and inactivated-->open transitions. Thus, in these cardiac myocytes, as with heterologously expressed HERG, IKr undergoes fast inactivation that determines its characteristic inward rectification. These studies demonstrate that the mechanism underlying decreased activating current observed at low [K+]o is more extensive fast inactivation.},

abstract = {The myocardial ischemic border zone is associated with the initiation and sustenance of arrhythmias. The profile of ionic concentrations across the border zone play a significant role in determining cellular electrophysiology and conductivity, yet their spatial-temporal evolution and regulation are not well understood. To investigate the changes in ion concentrations that regulate cellular electrophysiology, a mathematical model of ion movement in the intra and extracellular space in the presence of ionic, potential and material property heterogeneities was developed. The model simulates the spatial and temporal evolution of concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, hydrogen and bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide across an ischemic border zone. Ischemia was simulated by sodium-potassium pump inhibition, potassium channel activation and respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The model predicted significant disparities in the width of the border zone for each ionic species, with intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium having discordant gradients, facilitating multiple gradients in cellular properties across the border zone. Extracellular potassium was found to have the largest border zone and this was attributed to the voltage dependence of the potassium channels. The model also predicted the efflux of [Formula: see text] from the ischemic region due to electrogenic drift and diffusion within the intra and extracellular space, respectively, which contributed to [Formula: see text] depletion in the ischemic region.},

abstract = {T-wave alternans, a powerful marker of arrhythmic events, results from alternation in action potential duration (APD). The underlying cellular mechanism of APD alternans is unknown but has been attributed to either intracellular calcium (Ca2+) cycling or membrane ionic currents, manifested by a steep slope of cellular APD restitution. To address these mechanisms, high-resolution optical mapping techniques were used to measure action potentials and Ca2+ transients simultaneously from hundreds of epicardial sites in the guinea pig model of pacing-induced T-wave alternans (n=7). The pacing rates (ie, alternans threshold) at which T-wave (369+/-11 bpm), APD (369+/-21 bpm), and Ca2+ (371+/-29 bpm) alternans first appeared were comparable. Importantly, the site of origin of APD alternans and Ca2+ alternans consistently occurred together near the base of the left ventricle, not where APD restitution was steepest. In addition, APD and Ca2+ alternans were remarkably similar both spatially and temporally during discordant alternans. In conclusion, the mechanism underlying T-wave alternans in the intact heart is more closely associated with intracellular Ca2+ cycling rather than APD restitution.},

abstract = {Objectives: It is now well recognized that myocardial stretch can cause arrhythmias due to stretch-induced depolarizations. The effects of transient stretch applied during the various phases of the cardiac action potential have not been investigated. This study (1) examined the effects of short stretch pulses and sustained stretch on the monophasic action potential (MAP) repolarization time course and diastolic potential, (2) examined the arrhythmic response to differently timed stretch pulses, and (3) tested by comparison with computer simulations whether these effects are compatible with stretch-activated channel characteristics known from patch-clamp studies. Methods: We studied the MAP changes elicited by short transient stretch pulses applied at different times during the cardiac cycle to 8 isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The left ventricle (LV) was instrumented with a fluid-filled balloon, the volume of which was altered rapidly and precisely by means of a computer-controlled linear motor-driven piston. MAPs were recorded simultaneously from one right ventricular (RV) and two LV sites while short volume pulses of increasing amplitude were applied to the LV at variable delays after the last of 8 regular electrical pacing stimuli. The effect of pulsatile volume pulses applied at different phases of electrical systole and diastole was compared to the effect of sustained stretch pulses (60 s duration) of the same amplitude. The experimental results were compared with computer simulations of stretch-induced effects on the action potential to further validate the experimentally measured effects with theoretical predictions based on the Oxford Heart model with added stretch channel terms. Results: Stretch pulses applied during early systole caused a brief transient repolarization during the LV MAP plateau phase, with a maximal amplitude of 24 \^{A}± 10\% of the total MAP amplitude. Stretch pulses at the end of the MAP caused a transient depolarization, with a maximal amplitude of 13 \^{A}± 5\%. These oppositely polarized stretch effects crossed over during a transitional range of repolarization (mean 65 \^{A}± 9\% of repolarization) when stretch produced neither transient repolarizations nor depolarizations. Only stretch pulses applied at a mean repolarization level of 77 \^{A}± 5\% or later led to arrhythmias, preceded by transient depolarizations. No corresponding de- or repolarizations were seen in MAPs recorded simultaneously from the unstretched RV. The effects of long pulses on the MAP waveform were nearly identical to an overlay plot of the effects of many differently timed short transient pulses. When the stretch-induced voltage changes in the MAP were plotted against the repolarization level at which they were produced, a linear relationship was found (mean correlation coefficient r = 0.97; P < 0.0001) with a reversal at approximately half the total MAP amplitude. The computer simulations of the influence of stretch-activated channels reproduced both the effects of short and sustained stretch seen in the MAP recordings. Conclusions: We demonstrated in the isolated beating heart that the electrophysiologic effects of sudden myocardial stretch depend on the timing of the stretch relative to electrical systole or diastole. These findings are in agreement with patch clamp studies on stretch-activated ion channels which showed a linear current/voltage relation with a reversal potential between \^{a}20 and \^{a}30 mV. Only stretch pulses applied at the end of the action potential or during diastole elicit ectopic beats as a result of transient depolarizations, while stretch pulses applied during phase 2 and 3 cause transient repolarizations or no effect, respectively.},

abstract = {Across individuals within a population, several levels of variability are observed, from the differential expression of ion channels at the molecular level, to the various action potential morphologies observed at the cellular level, to divergent responses to drugs at the organismal level. However, the limited ability of experiments to probe complex interactions between components has hitherto hindered our understanding of the factors that cause a range of behaviors within a population. Variability is a challenging issue that is encountered in all physiological disciplines, but recent work suggests that novel methods for analyzing mathematical models can assist in illuminating its causes. In this review, we discuss mathematical modeling studies in cardiac electrophysiology and neuroscience that have enhanced our understanding of variability in a number of key areas. Specifically, we discuss parameter sensitivity analysis techniques that may be applied to generate quantitative predictions based on considering behaviors within a population of models, thereby providing novel insight into variability. Our discussion focuses on four issues that have benefited from the utilization of these methods: (1) the comparison of different electrophysiological models of cardiac myocytes, (2) the determination of the individual contributions of different molecular changes in complex disease phenotypes, (3) the identification of the factors responsible for the variable response to drugs, and (4) the constraining of free parameters in electrophysiological models of heart cells. Together, the studies that we discuss suggest that rigorous analyses of mathematical models can generate quantitative predictions regarding how molecular-level variations contribute to functional differences between experimental samples. These strategies may be applicable not just in cardiac electrophysiology, but in a wide range of disciplines.},

In this Series paper, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and the current role of catheter ablation for the three most common atrial arrhythmias encountered in clinical practice: focal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. The mechanisms of focal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter are well understood, and these arrhythmias are amenable to curative catheter ablation with high success rates. In most cases, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is initiated by triggers located within pulmonary vein musculature. Circumferential ablation to isolate this musculature is associated with high success rates for elimination of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in selected populations. Because of the problem of recurrent pulmonary vein connection, more than one procedure will be needed in about 30\% of patients, and new technologies are being developed to reduce this occurrence. The mechanisms that sustain persistent atrial fibrillation are not well understood and are the subject of continuing investigation. As such, ablation approaches and technologies for this arrhythmia are still evolving.},

CellML 1.1, an XML-based programming language, has been designed as a modelling standard which, by virtue of its import and grouping functions, facilitates model combination and reuse. Using CellML 1.1, we demonstrate the process of formalized model reuse by combining three separate models of rat cardiomyocyte function (an electrophysiology model, a model of cellular calcium dynamics and a mechanics model) which together make up the Pandit-Hinch-Niederer et al. cell model. Not only is this integrative model of rat electromechanics a useful tool for cardiac modelling but it is also an ideal framework with which to demonstrate both the power of model reuse and the challenges associated with this process.

abstract = {Since the development of the first mathematical cardiac cell model 50 years ago, computational modelling has become an increasingly powerful tool for the analysis of data and for the integration of information related to complex cardiac behaviour. Current models build on decades of iteration between experiment and theory, representing a collective understanding of cardiac function. All models, whether computational, experimental, or conceptual, are simplified representations of reality and, like tools in a toolbox, suitable for specific applications. Their range of applicability can be explored (and expanded) by iterative combination of 'wet' and 'dry' investigation, where experimental or clinical data are used to first build and then validate computational models (allowing integration of previous findings, quantitative assessment of conceptual models, and projection across relevant spatial and temporal scales), while computational simulations are utilized for plausibility assessment, hypotheses-generation, and prediction (thereby defining further experimental research targets). When implemented effectively, this combined wet/dry research approach can support the development of a more complete and cohesive understanding of integrated biological function. This review illustrates the utility of such an approach, based on recent examples of multi-scale studies of cardiac structure and mechano-electric function.},

abstract = {This article compares the Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+ that is triggered by a rapid increase of free Ca2+ concentration at the outer surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of a skinned cardiac cell to the spontaneous release of Ca2+ that is produced by a steady-state high free Ca2+ concentration which overloads the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+ in a skinned cardiac cell. The first process, that is triggered by a rapid increase of free Ca2+ concentration at the outer surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, has a time- and Ca(2+)-dependent activation and inactivation, does not require any preload of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+, and is not affected by the addition of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate. The second process, i.e. the spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is not inactivated by a high free Ca2+ concentration, requires an overload of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+ and is enhanced by inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. The filling inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+ is critical for the triggering of the spontaneous release of Ca2+. On the other hand, the spontaneous release of Ca2+ has many similarities to the "Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+" that is observed for isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles incorporated into a lipid bilayer which is triggered by the increase of free Ca2+ concentration at the outer surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although the Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+ with time- and Ca(2+)-dependent activation and inactivation and the spontaneous release of Ca2+ are regulated by difference mechanisms, they are both inhibited by ryanodine, which suggests that they may take place through the same channel and may even have some partial common pathway.},

abstract = {Purkinje cells play an important role in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis and are widely used in preclinical drug safety assessments. Repolarization abnormalities such as action potential (AP) prolongation and early afterdeploarizations (EAD) are often observed in vitro upon pharmacological interventions. However, because drugs do not act on only one defined target, it is often difficult to fully explain the mechanisms of action and their potential arrhythmogenicity. Computational models, when appropriately detailed and validated, can be used to gain mechanistic insights into the mechanisms of action of certain drugs. Nevertheless, no model of Purkinje electrophysiology that is able to reproduce characteristic Purkinje responses to drug-induced changes in ionic current conductances such as AP prolongation and EAD generation currently exists. In this study, a novel biophysically detailed model of rabbit Purkinje electrophysiology was developed by integration of data from voltage-clamp and AP experimental recordings. Upon validation, we demonstrate that the model reproduces many key electrophysiological properties of rabbit Purkinje cells. These include: AP morphology and duration, both input resistance and rate dependence properties as well as response to hyperkalemia. Pharmacological interventions such as inward rectifier K(+) current and rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current block as well as late Na(+) current increase result in significant AP changes. However, enhanced L-type Ca(2+) current (i(CaL)) dominates in EAD genesis in Purkinje fibers. In addition, i(CaL) inactivation dynamics and intercellular coupling in tissue strongly modulate EAD formation. We conclude that EAD generation in Purkinje cells is mediated by an increase in i(CaL) and modulated by its inactivation kinetics.},

@article{Armstrong1977,
abstract = {Gating current (Ig) has been studied in relation to inactivation of Na channels. No component of Ig has the time course of inactivation; apparently little or no charge movement is associated with this step. Inactivation nonetheless affects Ig by immobilizing about two-thirds of gating charge. Immobilization can be followed by measuring ON charge movement during a pulse and comparing it to OFF charge after the pulse. The OFF:ON ratio is near 1 for a pulse so short that no inactivation occurs, and the ratio drops to about one-third with a time course that parallels inactivation. Other correlations between inactivation and immobilization are that: (a) they have the same voltage dependence; (b) charge movement recovers with the time coures of recovery from inactivation. We interpret this to mean that the immobilized charge returns slowly to "off" position with the time course of recovery from inactivation, and that the small current generated is lost in base-line noise. At -150 mV recover is very rapid, and the immobilized charge forms a distinct slow component of current as it returns to off position. After destruction of inactivation by pronase, there is no immobilization of charge. A model is presented in which inactivation gains its voltage dependence by coupling to the activation gate.},

abstract = {Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) may develop into triggered automaticity and ventricular arrhythmias. However, the potential role of DADs in the genesis of ischemic arrhythmias is not clear. We studied the effects of different components of severe ischemia (acidosis, hypoxia, lactate, increased potassium, and the absence of glucose) on DADs. DADs were evoked using trains of 30-60 externally applied pulses at a rate of 4-5 Hz in the presence of isoproterenol (10(-7) M) or dibutyryl cyclic 3', 5' adenosine monophosphate (dB-cAMP, 10(-3) M). Acidosis, caused by the addition of protons (pH = 6.8), increased the amplitude of DADs from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.9 +/- 0.5 mV (n = 8, p less than 0.001). DADs were abolished by hypoxia (pO2 less than 35 mm Hg, n = 7, p less than 0.001) from control values of 3.4 +/- 0.3 mV. DADs were also abolished by neutral lactate (20 mM, n = 7, p less than 0.001) in the absence of glucose. Acidotic lactate (20 mM, pH0 = 6.8), however, was unable to abolish DADs. Increasing the extracellular potassium concentration to 16.2 mM decreased DAD amplitude from 3.6 +/- 0.27 mV to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mV (n = 5, p less than 0.002) with an associated reduction of membrane potential from -86.2 +/- 0.9 to -58.6 +/- 0.9 mV. The overall effect of simulated ischemia (all components tested together) was to abolish DADs (n = 8, p less than 0.001), with hypoxia as the most important factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

CELLULAR OPEN RESOURCE (COR) was among the early adopters of this standard, eventually forming the first publicly available CellML-based modelling and collaboration environment. From the onset, COR was designed to provide an environment that could not only be used by experienced modellers, but also by experimentalists, teachers and students. It therefore tries to combine a user-friendly interface with a computationally efficient numerical engine. In this paper, we introduce the philosophy behind COR, explain its user interface and current functionality, including the editing and running of CellML files, highlight lessons learned from user feedback and problems experienced during the development of COR and conclude by exploring future development potential.},

abstract = {1. Helix aspersa neurones under voltage clamp generate prolonged outward currents (potassium currents) in response to depolarizing command pulses. 2. The potassium currents recorded from cell A were reversibly reduced 25-50\% by 10 mM cobalt ions in the bathing medium; 1 mM lanthanum, 10(-6) g/ml. D-600 and 10(-6) g/ml. iproveratril had similar effects but were only partially reversible. 3. The relationship between the potassium currents and the membrane potential had an "n" shape in normal saline. In calcium-free saline (containing 25 mM magnesium) the potassium currents were reduced and the "n" shape was abolished. The effect of calcium-free saline was readily reversible. 4. The voltage-dependence of the calcium-sensitive potassium currents was similar to that of the "late" calcium channel in squid axons (Baker, Hodgkin \& Ridgway, 1971). 5. When cell A was depolarents were made up of two exponentially declining components. The slower of the two components was reduced in calcium-free saline. 6. When cell A was depolarized by 150 mV for 10 msec and then repolarized the "tail" currents were made up of a single rapidly declining component. The reversal potential of this component changed by 58 mV for a tenfold change in the external potassium concentration as predicted by the Nernst equation. 7. The reversal potential of "tail" currents having both components was less sensitive to changes in the external potassium concentration. 8. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) ions blocked both calcium dependent and voltage sensitive potassium currents. Each receptor was found to bind a single molecule of TEA. The dissociaton constant was about 10 mM in each case. 9. The intracellular concentration of ionized calcium was estimated from the potential at which there was no apparent calcium influx (the null point). It was between 3 x 10(-8) M and 8 x 10(-8) M with 10(-2) M calcium in the bathing medium. 10. The null point changed 30 mV for a tenfold change in the external calcium concentration as predicted by the Nernst equation. 11. It is concluded that depolarization of Helix neurones activates two typesof potassium channel. One channel is voltage dependent and highly selective for potassium. Activation of the other channel is dependent on the influx (or injection, see Meech, 1972, 1974a) of calcium. This calcium mediated potassium activation system saturates at high external calcium concentrations and is inhibited by external magnesium ions.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: A chromosomal haplotype producing cardiac overexpression of dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein-6 (DPP6) causes familial idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. The molecular basis of transient outward current (I(to)) in Purkinje fibers (PFs) is poorly understood. We hypothesized that DPP6 contributes to PF I(to) and that its overexpression might specifically alter PF I(to) properties and repolarization. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential role of DPP6 in PF I(to). METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical data in 5 idiopathic ventricular fibrillation patients suggested arrhythmia origin in the PF-conducting system. PF and ventricular muscle I(to) had similar density, but PF I(to) differed from ventricular muscle in having tetraethylammonium sensitivity and slower recovery. DPP6 overexpression significantly increased, whereas DPP6 knockdown reduced, I(to) density and tetraethylammonium sensitivity in canine PF but not in ventricular muscle cells. The K(+)-channel interacting $\beta$-subunit K(+)-channel interacting protein type-2, essential for normal expression of I(to) in ventricular muscle, was weakly expressed in human PFs, whereas DPP6 and frequenin (neuronal calcium sensor-1) were enriched. Heterologous expression of Kv4.3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced small I(to); I(to) amplitude was greatly enhanced by coexpression with K(+)-channel interacting protein type-2 or DPP6. Coexpression of DPP6 with Kv4.3 and K(+)-channel interacting protein type-2 failed to alter I(to) compared with Kv4.3/K(+)-channel interacting protein type-2 alone, but DPP6 expression with Kv4.3 and neuronal calcium sensor-1 (to mimic PF I(to) composition) greatly enhanced I(to) compared with Kv4.3/neuronal calcium sensor-1 and recapitulated characteristic PF kinetic/pharmacological properties. A mathematical model of cardiac PF action potentials showed that I(to) enhancement can greatly accelerate PF repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to a previously unknown central role of DPP6 in PF I(to), with DPP6 gain of function selectively enhancing PF current, and suggest that a DPP6-mediated PF early-repolarization syndrome might be a novel molecular paradigm for some forms of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.},

abstract = {In the absence of hypertrophic proliferation of microtubules, microtubule disruption by colchicine does not modulate contraction of adult cardiac myocytes. However, Gomez et al (Circ Res. 2000;86:30-36) recently reported that disruption of microtubules by colchicine in ruptured patch-clamped myocytes increased I(Ca,L) density and [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude and depressed the response of these parameters to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. These effects were ascribed to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by increased intracellular free tubulin. In the present study, we show that in intact rat ventricular myocytes, 2 to 4 hours of exposure to 10 micromol/L colchicine had no effect on shortening or [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude or on the amplitude of I(Ca,L) in perforated patch-clamped cells, under basal conditions and after stimulation with 1 micromol/L isoproterenol. However, in ruptured patch-clamped myocytes, basal I(Ca,L) was 2-fold higher after treatment with colchicine compared with vehicle and, in contrast to vehicle-treated cells, I(Ca,L) did not increase in response to isoproterenol. Cell width decreased during ruptured patch-clamp experiments in colchicine-treated but not vehicle-treated myocytes. We conclude that in cells with intact sarcolemma, colchicine does not modulate Ca(2+) signaling or the response to beta stimulation. However, the combination of microtubule disruption by colchicine and the ruptured patch configuration activates I(Ca,L) and attenuates the response to beta stimulation. We propose that these effects may be due to loss of free tubulin by intracellular dialysis or to increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation as a result of microtubule disruption. These findings have important implications for cardiomyopathies associated with decreased free tubulin or a diminished microtubular network.

abstract = {Purified Fab fragments of digoxin-specific antibodies obtained from sheep were used to treat 26 patients with advanced, life-threatening digoxin (23 cases) or digitoxin (3 cases) toxicity. These patients had advanced cardiac arrhythmias, and in some cases hyperkalemia, which were resistant to conventional treatment. All patients had an initial favorable response to doses of Fab fragments calculated (in most cases) to be equivalent, on a molar basis, to the amount of cardiac glycoside in the patient's body. In four patients treated after prolonged hypotension and low cardiac output, death ensued from cerebral or myocardial hypoperfusion. In one case the available Fab fragment supply was inadequate to reverse a massive suicidal ingestion of digoxin, and the patient died after recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. In the remaining 21 patients, cardiac rhythm disturbances and hyperkalemia were rapidly reversed, and full recovery ensued. There were no adverse reactions to the treatment. We conclude that the use of purified digoxin-specific Fab fragments is a safe and effective means to reverse advanced, life-threatening digitalis intoxication.},

abstract = {Available models of circus movement reentry in cardiac muscle and of drug action on reentrant arrhythmias are based on continuous medium theory, which depends solely on the membrane ionic conductances to alter propagation. The purpose of this study is to show that the anisotropic passive properties at a microscopic level highly determine the propagation response to modification of the sodium conductance by premature action potentials and by sodium channel-blocking drugs. In young, uniform anisotropic atrial bundles, propagation of progressively earlier premature action potentials continued as a smooth process until propagation ceased simultaneously in all directions. In older, nonuniform anisotropic bundles, however, premature action potentials produced either unidirectional longitudinal conduction block or a dissociated zigzag type of longitudinal conduction (a safer type of propagation, similar to transverse propagation). Directional differences in the velocity of premature action potentials demonstrated that anisotropic propagation was necessary for a reentrant circuit to be contained within an area of 50 mm2, even with very short refractory periods. Quinidine produced Wenckebach periodicity, which disappeared after acetylcholine shortened the action potential. Quinidine also produced use-dependent dissociated zigzag longitudinal conduction in the older, nonuniform anisotropic bundles but not in the young, uniform anisotropic bundles. The electrophysiological consequence was that propagation events differed in an age-related manner in response to the same modification of the sodium conductance. The electrical events at microscopic level showed that conditions leading to obliteration of side-to-side electrical coupling between fibers (e.g., aging and chronic hypertrophy) provide a primary mechanism for reentry to occur within very small areas (1-2 mm) due to a variety of propagation phenomena that do not occur in tissues with tight electrical coupling in all directions.},

abstract = {The effect of ischemia on the function of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was assessed by the calcium uptake rate of rat whole-heart homogenates in the presence of 10 mM oxalate. Previous studies have shown that this uptake is restricted to the SR. The contribution of the ryanodine-sensitive fractions of the SR to the total homogenate uptake was assessed by using 20 microM ruthenium red and 625 microM ryanodine to close the SR calcium release channel under previously established optimal conditions. Global ischemia of 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes depressed homogenate calcium uptake rate 19 +/- 2\%, 50 +/- 6\%, 65 +/- 3\%, and 81 +/- 5\%, respectively. This decrease was not observed when the uptake rates were measured after closure of the calcium channel with ryanodine or ruthenium red. Similar results were obtained with a Langendorff in vitro perfusion preparation, in which calcium uptake was decreased 35 +/- 5\%, 37 +/- 8\%, 58 +/- 7\%, and 64 +/- 4\% after 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes of ischemia, but no significant decrease was observed when homogenate uptake rates were measured in the presence of ryanodine. Thus, ischemia caused a depression in the calcium uptake rate of cardiac SR only when this activity was measured in the absence of SR calcium channel blockers. Reperfusion of ischemic hearts in a Langendorff preparation resulted in recovery of homogenate calcium uptake activity that correlated well with the return to sinus rhythm of the reperfused hearts. These reperfused hearts showed no change in the calcium uptake rate measured in the presence of ryanodine. These results suggest that the decrease in homogenate calcium uptake caused by ischemia is not due to a defect in calcium pumping capabilities but is due to an increased efflux through the ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channel of cardiac SR.},

abstract = {Repolarization reserve is a term used to indicate the existence of redundancy of repolarizing currents in cardiac cells. It provides safety and prevents cardiac arrhythmias due to excessive prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and generation of early afterdepolarizations. The existence of repolarization reserve in cardiac cells and its modulation is the main topic of this short review. Under physiological conditions repolarization reserve is modulated by increase of frequency, sympathetic stimulation and the accompanying rise in [Ca2+]i, [Na+]i and [K+]e. The analysis of the changes by frequency and activation of the sympathetic system reveals an increase in repolarization reserve. At elevated rates APD shortening is caused by enhancement of outward currents (IKr, IKs and INa,K), while inward currents are decreased (INa, late and ICaL due to faster inactivation; peak ICaL may be increased by acceleration of recovery from inactivation). Under sympathetic stimulation not only sinus rate increases but specific effects occur at the ventricular level by activation of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-receptors. Major effects occur via activation of $\beta$-receptors which result in an increase of ICaL, IKr, IKs and INa,K, elevation of the plateau and further shortening of the APD. Pathological reduction of repolarization reserve with increased risk of deadly arrhythmias can be of hereditary (congenital LQTsyndromes) or of an acquired nature. One of the more frequent and dangerous forms of acquired LQT is caused by the use of medications. The drugs responsible belong to different groups but have the common effect of blocking K+ currents. Since not all patients using these drugs show complications of arrhythmias attention should be given to the underlying risk factors, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, female sex, predisposing DNA polymorphisms, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy. It is the aim of future research, especially in the case of hypertrophy and failure to unravel the remodeling mechanisms responsible for increased risk. In this way it will become possible to prevent excessive reduction of repolarization reserve and to preserve a normal repolarization.},

abstract = {1. In rabbit and human hearts there are significant differences in the action potential configuration in atrium and ventricle, and the action potential waveform exhibits marked frequency dependence in both tissues. To study the ionic mechanism(s) of these phenomena, the size and time course of the potassium (K+) currents responsible for repolarization have been recorded from single cells using a whole-cell microelectrode voltage clamp method. 2. At physiological heart rates, the action potential in atrial cells has a short plateau phase; however, the rapid early repolarization is strongly frequency dependent. Ventricular myocytes have a long plateau (400-700 ms at 23 degrees C), and the late repolarizing phase of the action potential is much faster in ventricle than in atrium. 3. In both cell types, four different outward currents can be recorded: (i) a large transient outward current, It; (ii) IK(Ca), a smaller Ca2+-dependent K+ current; (iii) IK, a small, maintained time- and voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K+ current; (iv) IK1, an inwardly rectifying K+ current. 4. It, which is responsible for early repolarization, is much larger in atrium than in ventricle. It has very rapid activation and inactivation kinetics but a very slow time course of recovery from inactivation (tau = 5.4 s at 23 degrees C). Our results show that the reactivation kinetics of It are responsible for the pronounced dependence of the shape of the atrial action potential on stimulus frequency. 5. IK(Ca) is variable from cell to cell and is larger in atrium than in ventricle. In both cell types, IK(Ca) is much smaller than It. 6. The delayed rectifier current, IK, is very small and turns on relatively slowly in both cell types. It is therefore not activated strongly during the relatively short plateau of the atrial action potential. Even in ventricle, it contributes only a small repolarizing current. 7. IK1, the inward rectifier K+ current, is much larger in ventricle than in atrium. The current-voltage relationship for IK1 in ventricle exhibits a negative slope conductance between -50 and 0 mV. IK1 is the outward current which generates the resting membrane potential and it modulates the final repolarization phase of the action potential in both cell types. 8. These data strongly suggest that the action potential configuration and its frequency dependence in rabbit atrial and ventricular cells are mainly due to the differences in sizes and kinetics of It and IK1.},

Ischemia shortened action potential duration, and decreased its amplitude, upstroke velocity, and resting potential. The cells were unresponsive after 12 to 15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion, yet near normal action potentials could be restored by flushing the occluded artery with saline as late as 40 minutes after occlusion. The unipolar extracellular electrogram reflected unresponsiveness by a monophasic potential. Local refractory periods initially shortened by up to 100 msec. Later, postrepolarization refractoriness occurred and refractory periods lengthened often in excess of basic cycle length, thus resulting in 2:1 responses. The onset of early ventricular arrhythmias often coincided with a period of alternation and 2:1 responses, especially when these got out of phase in different regions. Reperfusion frequently led to ventricular fibrillation, and was associated with marked inhomogeneity in cellular responses. Re-entry within ischemic myocardium was the most likely mechanism for arrhythmias.},

abstract = {The cardiac cell is a complex biological system where various processes interact to generate electrical excitation (the action potential, AP) and contraction. During AP generation, membrane ion channels interact nonlinearly with dynamically changing ionic concentrations and varying transmembrane voltage, and are subject to regulatory processes. In recent years, a large body of knowledge has accumulated on the molecular structure of cardiac ion channels, their function, and their modification by genetic mutations that are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, ion channels are typically studied in isolation (in expression systems or isolated membrane patches), away from the physiological environment of the cell where they interact to generate the AP. A major challenge remains the integration of ion-channel properties into the functioning, complex and highly interactive cell system, with the objective to relate molecular-level processes and their modification by disease to whole-cell function and clinical phenotype. In this article we describe how computational biology can be used to achieve such integration. We explain how mathematical (Markov) models of ion-channel kinetics are incorporated into integrated models of cardiac cells to compute the AP. We provide examples of mathematical (computer) simulations of physiological and pathological phenomena, including AP adaptation to changes in heart rate, genetic mutations in SCN5A and HERG genes that are associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and effects of the CaMKII regulatory pathway and beta-adrenergic cascade on the cell electrophysiological function.},

abstract = {Human atrial transient outward K(+) current (I(TO)) is decreased in a variety of cardiac pathologies, but how I(TO) reduction alters action potentials (APs) and arrhythmia mechanisms is poorly understood, owing to non-selectivity of I(TO) blockers. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of selective I(TO) changes on AP shape and duration (APD), and on afterdepolarisations or abnormal automaticity with $\beta$-adrenergic-stimulation, using the dynamic-clamp technique in atrial cells. Human and rabbit atrial cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation, and electrical activity recorded by whole-cell-patch clamp (35-37°C). Dynamic-clamp-simulated I(TO) reduction or block slowed AP phase 1 and elevated the plateau, significantly prolonging APD, in both species. In human atrial cells, I(TO) block (100\% I(TO) subtraction) increased APD(50) by 31\%, APD(90) by 17\%, and APD(-61 mV) (reflecting cellular effective refractory period) by 22\% (P < 0.05 for each). Interrupting I(TO) block at various time points during repolarisation revealed that the APD(90) increase resulted mainly from plateau-elevation, rather than from phase 1-slowing or any residual I(TO). In rabbit atrial cells, partial I(TO) block (∼40\% I(TO) subtraction) reversibly increased the incidence of cellular arrhythmic depolarisations (CADs; afterdepolarisations and/or abnormal automaticity) in the presence of the $\beta$-agonist isoproterenol (0.1 $\mu$m; ISO), from 0\% to 64\% (P < 0.05). ISO-induced CADs were significantly suppressed by dynamic-clamp increase in I(TO) (∼40\% I(TO) addition). ISO+I(TO) decrease-induced CADs were abolished by $\beta$(1)-antagonism with atenolol at therapeutic concentration (1 $\mu$m). Atrial cell action potential changes from selective I(TO) modulation, shown for the first time using dynamic-clamp, have the potential to influence reentrant and non-reentrant arrhythmia mechanisms, with implications for both the development and treatment of atrial fibrillation.},

abstract = {Cardiac cellular calcium (Ca2+) handling is the well-investigated mediator of excitation-contraction coupling, the process that translates cardiac electrical activation into mechanical events. The reverse--effects of mechanical stimulation on cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling--are much less well understood, in particular during the inter-beat period, called 'diastole'. We have investigated the effects of diastolic length changes, applied axially using a pair of carbon fibres attached to opposite ends of Guinea pig isolated ventricular myocytes, on the availability of Ca2+ in the main cellular stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum; SR), by studying the rest-decay of SR Ca2+ content [Ca2+]SR, and the reloading of the SR after prior depletion of Ca2+ from the cell. Cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM (an indicator of the cytosolic 'free' Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i), and pre-conditioned by field-stimulation (2 Hz) at 37 degrees C, while [Ca2+]i transients and sarcomere length (SL) were recorded simultaneously. After reaching a steady state in the behaviour of observed parameters, stimulation was interrupted for between 5 and 60s, while cells were either held at resting length, or stretched (controlled to cause a 10\% increase in SL, to aid inter-individual comparison). Thereafter, each cell was returned to its original resting length, followed by swift administration of 10mM of caffeine (in Na+/Ca2+-free solution), which causes the release of Ca2+ from the SR (caffeine), but largely prevents extrusion of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the cell exterior (Na+/Ca2+-free solution). By comparing the [Ca2+]i in cells exposed/not exposed to diastolic stretch of different duration, we assessed the rest-decay dynamics of [Ca2+]SR. To assess SR reloading after initial Ca2+ depletion, the same stretch protocol was implemented after prior emptying of the cell by application of 10mM of caffeine in normal Tyrode solution (which causes Ca2+ to be released from the SR and extruded from the cell via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; NCX). Axial stretch enhanced the rate of both rest-decay and reloading of [Ca2+]SR. Application of 40 microM streptomycin, a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels, did not affect the stretch-induced increase in SR reloading. This behaviour was reproduced in a computer simulation study, using a modified version of the 2006 Iribe-Kohl-Noble model of single cardiac myocyte Ca2+ handling, suggesting that stretch increases both Ca2+ leak from the SR and Ca2+ influx via the sarcolemma. This may have important implications for the mobilisation of Ca2+ in stretched cells, and could contribute to the regional 'matching' of individual cardiomyocyte contractility to dynamic, and regionally varying, changes in mechanical loads, such as diastolic pre-load, of cardiac tissue.},

The present study was designed to determine the potential role of Ca2+ current (ICa) in the rate-dependent changes in action potential duration (APD) in human ventricular cells. Myocytes isolated from the right ventricle of explanted human hearts were studied at 36 degreesC with whole cell voltage and current-clamp techniques. APD at 90\% repolarization decreased by 36 +/- 4\% when frequency increased from 0.5 to 2 Hz. Equimolar substitution of Mg2+ for Ca2+ significantly decreased rate-dependent changes in APD (to 6 +/- 3\%, P < 0.01). Peak ICa was decreased by 34 +/- 3\% from 0.5 to 2 Hz (P < 0.01), and ICa had recovery time constants of 65 +/- 12 and 683 +/- 39 ms at -80 mV. Action potential clamp demonstrated a decreasing contribution of ICa during the action potential as rate increased. The rate-dependent slow component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) was not observed in four cells with an increase in frequency from 0.5 to 3.3 Hz, perhaps because the IKs is so small that the increase at a high rate could not be seen. These results suggest that reduction of Ca2+ influx during the action potential accounts for most of the rate-dependent abbreviation of human ventricular APD.},

abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. In fibrillation, fragmented electrical waves meander erratically through the heart muscle, creating disordered and ineffective contraction. Theoretical and computer studies, as well as recent experimental evidence, have suggested that fibrillation is created and sustained by the property of restitution of the cardiac action potential duration (that is, its dependence on the previous diastolic interval). The restitution hypothesis states that steeply sloped restitution curves create unstable wave propagation that results in wave break, the event that is necessary for fibrillation. Here we present experimental evidence supporting this idea. In particular, we identify the action of the drug bretylium as a prototype for the future development of effective restitution-based antifibrillatory agents. We show that bretylium acts in accord with the restitution hypothesis: by flattening restitution curves, it prevents wave break and thus prevents fibrillation. It even converts existing fibrillation, either to a periodic state (ventricular tachycardia, which is much more easily controlled) or to quiescent healthy tissue.},

abstract = {Cardiac electrical activity is significantly affected by variations in the conductance of gap junctions that connect myocytes to one another. To better understand how intrinsic (single cell) electrical activity is modulated by junctional conductance, we used a two-myocyte coupling system in which physically separate cells were electrically coupled via a variable resistance set by the investigator. This brief review summarizes our findings regarding: (1) the effect of the early phase of action potential repolarization (phase 1) and transient outward current (I(to)) on action potential conduction, and (2) the effect of coupling on the action potential plateau (late repolarization). We found that inhibition of I(to) markedly increased the ability of action potentials to propagate from cell-to-cell when junctional conductance was low. Electrically coupling two myocytes together also suppressed their beat-to-beat variability in action potential duration and contraction. Similarly, early afterdepolarizations (EADS) were readily suppressed by connecting a normal myocyte to one generating EADs. This high sensitivity of the plateau to variations in junctional interactions arises from the large increase in membrane resistance that occurs during this phase of the action potential.},

abstract = {In voltage-dependent Na, K, or Ca channels, the probability of opening is modified by the membrane potential. This is achieved through a voltage sensor that detects the voltage and transfers its energy to the pore to control its gate. We present here the theoretical basis of the energy coupling between the electric field and the voltage, which allows the interpretation of the gating charge that moves in one channel. Movement of the gating charge constitutes the gating current. The properties are described, along with macroscopic data and gating current noise analysis, in relation to the operation of the voltage sensor and the opening of the channel. Structural details of the voltage sensor operation were resolved initially by locating the residues that make up the voltage sensor using mutagenesis experiments and determining the number of charges per channel. The changes in conformation are then analyzed based on the differential exposure of cysteine or histidine-substituted residues. Site-directed fluorescence labeling is then analyzed as another powerful indicator of conformational changes that allows time and voltage correlation of local changes seen by the fluorophores with the global change seen by the electrophysiology of gating currents and ionic currents. Finally, we describe the novel results on lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer that show small distance changes between residues in the channel molecule. All of the electrophysiological and the structural information are finally summarized in a physical model of a voltage-dependent channel in which a change in membrane potential causes rotation of the S4 segment that changes the exposure of the basic residues from an internally connected aqueous crevice at hyperpolarized potentials to an externally connected aqueous crevice at depolarized potentials.},

The effects of I(Ks) block by chromanol 293B and L-735,821 on rabbit QT-interval, action potential duration (APD), and membrane current were compared to those of E-4031, a recognized I(Kr) blocker. Measurements were made in rabbit Langendorff-perfused whole hearts, isolated papillary muscle, and single isolated ventricular myocytes. 2. Neither chromanol 293B (10 microM) nor L-735,821 (100 nM) had a significant effect on QTc interval in Langendorff-perfused hearts. E-4031 (100 nM), on the other hand, significantly increased QTc interval (35.6+/-3.9\%, n=8, P<0.05). 3. Similarly both chromanol 293B (10 microM) and L-735,821 (100 nM) produced little increase in papillary muscle APD (less than 7\%) while pacing at cycle lengths between 300 and 5000 ms. In contrast, E-4031 (100 nM) markedly increased (30 - 60\%) APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. 4. In ventricular myocytes, the same concentrations of chromanol 293B (10 microM), L-735,821 (100 nM) and E-4031 (1 microM) markedly or totally blocked I(Ks) and I(Kr), respectively. 5. I(Ks) tail currents activated slowly (at +30 mV, tau=888.1+/-48.2 ms, n=21) and deactivated rapidly (at -40 mV, tau=157.1+/-4.7 ms, n=22), while I(Kr) tail currents activated rapidly (at +30 mV, tau=35.5+/-3.1 ms, n=26) and deactivated slowly (at -40 mV, tau(1)=641.5+/-29.0 ms, tau(2)=6531+/-343, n=35). I(Kr) was estimated to contribute substantially more to total current density during normal ventricular muscle action potentials (i.e., after a 150 ms square pulse to +30 mV) than does I(Ks). 6. These findings indicate that block of I(Ks) is not likely to provide antiarrhythmic benefit by lengthening normal ventricular muscle QTc, APD, and refractoriness over a wide range of frequencies.},

abstract = {In the congenital long-QT syndrome, prolongation of the cardiac action potential occurs by an unknown mechanism and predisposes individuals to syncope and sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome by the identification of multiple distinct loci, and associated mutations in two candidate genes have recently been reported. One form of hereditary long QT (LQT3) has been linked to a mutation in the gene encoding the human heart voltage-gated sodium-channel alpha-subunit (SCN5A on chromosome 3p21). Here we characterize this mutation using heterologous expression of recombinant human heart sodium channels. Mutant channels show a sustained inward current during membrane depolarization. Single-channel recordings indicate that mutant channels fluctuate between normal and non-inactivating gating modes. Persistent inward sodium current explains prolongation of cardiac action potentials, and provides a molecular mechanism for this form of congenital long-QT syndrome.},

abstract = {The mechanism of rectification of HERG, the human cardiac delayed rectifier K+ channel, was studied after heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Currents were measured using two-microelectrode and macropatch voltage clamp techniques. The fully activated current-voltage (I-V) relationship for HERG inwardly rectified. Rectification was not altered by exposing the cytoplasmic side of a macropatch to a divalent-free solution, indicating this property was not caused by voltage-dependent block of outward current by Mg2+ or other soluble cytosolic molecules. The instantaneous I-V relationship for HERG was linear after removal of fast inactivation by a brief hyperpolarization. The time constants for the onset of and recovery from inactivation were a bell-shaped function of membrane potential. The time constants of inactivation varied from 1.8 ms at +50 mV to 16 ms at -20 mV; recovery from inactivation varied from 4.7 ms at -120 mV to 15 ms at -50 mV. Truncation of the NH2-terminal region of HERG shifted the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation by +20 to +30 mV. In addition, the rate of deactivation of the truncated channel was much faster than wild-type HERG. The mechanism of HERG rectification is voltage-gated fast inactivation. Inactivation of channels proceeds at a much faster rate than activation, such that no outward current is observed upon depolarization to very high membrane potentials. Fast inactivation of HERG and the resulting rectification are partly responsible for the prolonged plateau phase typical of ventricular action potentials.},

abstract = {A computer (PDP-10) simulation model was constructed using rapid, simultaneous measurements of effective refractory period (ERP), ERP dispersion (RPD), premature ventricular beat (PVB) thresholds, and multi-directional conduction times during coronary artery ligations and release in the anesthetized dog. In addition, estimates of currents of injury between ischemic and non-ischemic electrodes were included based on published data from electromagnetic recordings in dogs. Propagated PVB's were inscribed by the model when criteria for excitation, dispersion, and conduction were met based on known electrophysiological characteristics of heart muscle. The model correctly predicts high vulnerability to arrhythmias at three to seven minutes of ligation, stabilization at 10 to 15 minutes of ligation, and decreased vulnerability by lidocaine during ischemia. There was no arrhythmia when ischemic thresholds were increased by the drug before significant RPD and conduction prolongation developed. Vulnerability to arrhythmias was also predicted by the model after release of short (five minute) and long (15 minute) ligation. Since (experimentally) arrhythmias occurred much more frequently after long ligations, additional yet unknown factors other than those considered in the model must be operative in the genesis of reperfusion arrhythmias. This conclusion is supported by the observations that high ischemic thresholds induced by lidocaine returned to normal slowly after ligation release, and despite this protective effect, experimentally, lidocaine failed to abolish reperfusion arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.},

abstract = {Although transmural heterogeneity of action potential duration (APD) is established in single cells isolated from different tissue layers, the extent to which it produces transmural gradients of repolarization in electrotonically coupled ventricular myocardium remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative contribution of intrinsic cellular gradients of APD and electrotonic influences to transmural repolarization in rabbit ventricular myocardium. Transmural optical mapping was performed in left ventricular wedge preparations from eight rabbits. Transmural patterns of activation, repolarization, and APD were recorded during endocardial and epicardial stimulation. Experimental results were compared with modeled data during variations in electrotonic coupling. A transmural gradient of APD was evident during endocardial stimulation, which reflected differences previously seen in isolated cells, with the longest APD at the endocardium and the shortest at the epicardium (endo: 165 ± 5 vs. epi: 147 ± 4 ms; P < 0.05). During epicardial stimulation, this gradient reversed (epi: 162 ± 4 vs. endo: 148 ± 6 ms; P < 0.05). In both activation sequences, transmural repolarization followed activation and APD shortened along the activation path such that significant transmural gradients of repolarization did not occur. This correlation between transmural activation time and APD was recapitulated in simulations and varied with changes in intercellular coupling, confirming that it is mediated by electrotonic current flow between cells. These data suggest that electrotonic influences are important in determining the transmural repolarization sequence in rabbit ventricular myocardium and that they are sufficient to overcome intrinsic differences in the electrophysiological properties of the cells across the ventricular wall.},

abstract = {Visual clutter denotes a disordered collection of graphical entities in information visualization. Clutter can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset, clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewer’s understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization’s expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display.},

@article{Janse2004,
abstract = {This review focuses mainly on studies in non-ischemic animal models of heart failure. These animals develop ventricular arrhythmias, mostly non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and often die suddenly. Clinical studies suggest that sudden death is due to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in about 50\% of cases, the other half to bradyarrhythmias or electromechanical dissociation. Electrophysiologic changes in heart failure are not confined to the ventricles: the intrinsic sinus rate is reduced due to a downregulation of If and sensitivity to acetylcholine is enhanced by upregulation of the muscarinic receptor. Reduction of heart rate may be a protective mechanism since at rapid rates contractility is reduced and the likelihood for triggered activity due to delayed afterdepolarizations is enhanced. The beneficial effect of beta-adrenergic blockade in patients may be partly due to the reduction in sinus rate. Although the results of different studies often vary, the most consistent electrophysiological changes in the ventricles are prolongation of the action potential, especially at slow rates, a reduction in the transient outward current Ito, the rapid and slow components of the delayed rectifier Ikr and Iks, and the inward rectifier Ik1. Abnormalities in intracellular calcium handling play a major role in the genesis of delayed afterdepolarizations. Triggered activity based on delayed afterdepolarizations has been demonstrated in failing myocardium and are caused by spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), especially in the presence of noradrenaline. Three factors combine to the enhanced propensity for the occurrence of delayed afterdepolarizations: (1) increased activity of the Na/Ca exchanger, (2) a reduced inward rectifier, (3) residual beta-adrenergic responsiveness required to raise the reduced sarcoplasmic calcium content to a level where spontaneous calcium release occurs. Early afterdepolarizations have also been demonstrated, especially in human myocytes from failing hearts in the presence of noradrenaline. Mapping experiments have shown that the ventricular arrhythmias are mainly due to non-reentrant mechanisms, most likely triggered activity based on delayed afterdepolarizations.},

abstract = {The effect of action potential duration and elevated cytosolic sodium concentration on the force-frequency relationship in isolated rabbit, guinea pig and rat papillary muscle preparations was studied. Shortening of action potential duration in guinea pig and rabbit from 150-200 ms to values characteristic of rat (20-40 ms), using the K(ATP) channel activator levkromakalim (15 mumol.l-1), markedly reduced the force of contraction and converted the positive force-frequency relationship into negative one at longer pacing cycle lengths. This conversion was greatly enhanced in the presence of acetylstrophanthidin (0.2-1 mumol.l-1), an inhibitor of the Na-K pump. Acetylstrophanthidin (1 mumol.l-1) alone, however, had no effect on the force-frequency relationship. Prolongation of action potential duration in rat with inhibitors of cardiac K channels (4-aminopyridine [10 mmol.l-1] plus tetraethylammonium [2 mmol.l-1) increased the force of contraction and abolished the negative force-frequency relationship observed in rat at longer pacing-cycle lengths. It is concluded that both action potential duration and cytosolic sodium concentration are major determinants of the force-frequency relationship in mammalian myocardium.},

abstract = {Since Keith and Flack's anatomical discovery of the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart, the question of how such a small SAN structure can pace the entire heart has remained for a large part unanswered. Recent advances in optical mapping technology have made it possible to unambiguously resolve the origin of excitation and conduction within the animal and human SAN. The combination of high-resolution optical mapping and histological structural analysis reveals that the canine and human SANs are functionally insulated from the surrounding atrial myocardium, except for several critical conduction pathways. Indeed, the SAN as a leading pacemaker requires anatomical (fibrosis, fat, and blood vessels) and/or functional barriers (paucity of connexins) to protect it from the hyperpolarizing influence of the surrounding atrium. The presence of conduction barriers and pathways may help explain how a small cluster of pacemaker cells in the SAN pacemaker complex manages to depolarize different, widely distributed areas of the right atria as evidenced functionally by exit points and breakthroughs. The autonomic nervous system and humoral factors can further regulate conduction through these pathways, affecting pacemaker automaticity and ultimately heart rate. Moreover, the conduction barriers and multiple pathways can form substrates for reentrant activity and thus lead to atrial flutter and fibrillation. This review aims to provide new insight into the function of the SAN pacemaker complex and the interaction between the atrial pacemakers and the surrounding atrial myocardium not only in animal models but also human hearts.},

abstract = {In congenital and acquired long QT type 2, women are more vulnerable than men to torsade de pointes. In prepubertal rabbits (and children), the arrhythmia phenotype is reversed; however, females still have longer action potential durations than males. Thus, sex differences in K(+) channels and action potential durations alone cannot account for sex-dependent arrhythmia phenotypes. The L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) is another determinant of action potential duration, Ca(2+) overload, early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and torsade de pointes. Therefore, sex, age, and regional differences in I(Ca,L) density and in EAD susceptibility were analyzed in epicardial left ventricular myocytes isolated from the apex and base of prepubertal and adult rabbit hearts. In prepubertal rabbits, peak I(Ca,L) at the base was 22\% higher in males than females (6.4+/-0.5 versus 5.0+/-0.2 pA/pF; P<0.03) and higher than at the apex (6.4+/-0.5 versus 5.0+/-0.3 pA/pF; P<0.02). Sex differences were reversed in adults: I(Ca,L) at the base was 32\% higher in females than males (9.5+/-0.7 versus 6.4+/-0.6 pA/pF; P<0.002) and 28\% higher than the apex (9.5+/-0.7 versus 6.9+/-0.5 pA/pF; P<0.01). Apex-base differences in I(Ca,L) were not significant in adult male and prepubertal female hearts. Western blot analysis showed that Ca(v)1.2alpha levels varied with sex, maturity, and apex-base, with differences similar to variations in I(Ca,L); optical mapping revealed that the earliest EADs fired at the base. Single myocyte experiments and Luo-Rudy simulations concur that I(Ca,L) elevation promotes EADs and is an important determinant of long QT type 2 arrhythmia phenotype, most likely by reducing repolarization reserve and by enhancing Ca(2+) overload and the propensity for I(Ca,L) reactivation.},

abstract = {Van der Pol's equation for a relaxation oscillator is generalized by the addition of terms to produce a pair of non-linear differential equations with either a stable singular point or a limit cycle. The resulting "BVP model" has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic modulation of repolarization is important in arrhythmogenesis. An inverse relation exists in myocardium between activation time (AT) and action potential duration (APD). We hypothesized that resulting gradients of APD and diastolic interval (DI) interact with restitution properties and modulate the timing of repolarization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Activation-recovery intervals (ARI) were acquired from reconstructed noncontact unipolar electrograms from the left ventricular endocardium in 9 patients (7 male) with normal ventricles. At a basic paced cycle length (median, 450 ms), ARIs shortened along the path of activation, with a mandatory reciprocal increase of DIs. In the median patient, this range of DIs started at 230 ms at the site of earliest activation and increased to 279 ms at the site of latest activation at a basic cycle length of 450 ms. Four consecutive standard S1 to S2 restitution curves were performed. At sites with a longer ARI (and therefore shorter DI) close to the site of stimulation, premature stimulation produced more shortening of ARIs; therefore, the time course of restitution was steeper than at more distal sites. At normal heart rate, the decrease in ARIs along the conduction pathway compensated for later activation. Thus, dispersion in repolarization time (RT) is smaller than dispersion in ARI in a heart with a steep negative AT-ARI relationship. This protective effect is lost in hearts without such a relationship. In the patients with a steep AT-ARI relationship at basic cycle length, this relation is lost after premature stimulation and is a function of prematurity. Thus, dispersion in RT is larger after shortly coupled extra stimuli in patients with a steep AT-ARI relationship. CONCLUSIONS: A complex interplay exists between activation-repolarization coupling and restitution properties, largely driven by ARI and DI gradients. This plays a significant role in the dynamics of repolarization in humans.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) readily promotes early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activity (TA) in isolated rat and rabbit ventricular myocytes. Here we examined the effects of H(2)O(2) on arrhythmias in intact Langendorff rat and rabbit hearts using dual-membrane voltage and intracellular calcium optical mapping and glass microelectrode recordings. Young adult rat (3-5 mo, N = 25) and rabbit (3-5 mo, N = 6) hearts exhibited no arrhythmias when perfused with H(2)O(2) (0.1-2 mM) for up to 3 h. However, in 33 out of 35 (94\%) aged (24-26 mo) rat hearts, 0.1 mM H(2)O(2) caused EAD-mediated TA, leading to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). Aged rabbits (life span, 8-12 yr) were not available, but 4 of 10 middle-aged rabbits (3-5 yr) developed EADs, TA, VT, and VF. These arrhythmias were suppressed by the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (2 mM) and CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1 microM) but not by its inactive form (KN-92, 1 microM). There were no significant differences between action potential duration (APD) or APD restitution slope before or after H(2)O(2) in aged or young adult rat hearts. In histological sections, however, trichrome staining revealed that aged rat hearts exhibited extensive fibrosis, ranging from 10-90\%; middle-aged rabbit hearts had less fibrosis (5-35\%), whereas young adult rat and rabbit hearts had <4\% fibrosis. In aged rat hearts, EADs and TA arose most frequently (70\%) from the left ventricular base where fibrosis was intermediate ( approximately 30\%). Computer simulations in two-dimensional tissue incorporating variable degrees of fibrosis showed that intermediate (but not mild or severe) fibrosis promoted EADs and TA. We conclude that in aged ventricles exposed to oxidative stress, fibrosis facilitates the ability of cellular EADs to emerge and generate TA, VT, and VF at the tissue level.},

However, no currently available detailed action potential model accurately reproduces the dynamics of the cardiac action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling at rapid heart rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35-37 degrees C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.},

abstract = {During the past few years, the development of effective, empirical technologies for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has exceeded the pace at which detailed knowledge of the underlying biology has accumulated. As a result, although some clinical arrhythmias can be cured with techniques such as catheter ablation, drug treatment and prediction of the risk of sudden death remain fairly primitive. The identification of key candidate genes for monogenic arrhythmia syndromes shows that to bring basic biology to the clinic is a powerful approach. Increasingly sophisticated experimental models and methods of measurement, including stem cell-based models of human cardiac arrhythmias, are being deployed to study how perturbations in several biologic pathways can result in an arrhythmia-prone heart. The biology of arrhythmia is largely quantifiable, which allows for systematic analysis that could transform treatment strategies that are often still empirical into management based on molecular evidence.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: The Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilaments is increased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other heart diseases and may contribute to a higher risk for sudden cardiac death. Ca(2+) sensitization increases susceptibility to reentrant ventricular tachycardia in animal models, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization creates reentrant arrhythmia susceptibility. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mouse models (troponinT-I79N) and a Ca(2+) sensitizing drug (EMD57033), here we identify focal energy deprivation as a direct consequence of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization. To detect ATP depletion and thus energy deprivation, we measured accumulation of dephosphorylated Connexin 43 (Cx43) isoform P0 and AMP kinase activation by Western blotting and immunostaining. No differences were detected between groups at baseline, but regional accumulation of Connexin 43 isoform P0 occurred within minutes in all Ca(2+)-sensitized hearts, in vivo after isoproterenol challenge and in isolated hearts after rapid pacing. Lucifer yellow dye spread demonstrated reduced gap junctional coupling in areas with Connexin 43 isoform P0 accumulation. Optical mapping revealed that selectively the transverse conduction velocity was slowed and anisotropy increased. Myofilament Ca(2+) desensitization with blebbistatin prevented focal energy deprivation, transverse conduction velocity slowing, and the reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization rapidly leads to focal energy deprivation and reduced intercellular coupling during conditions that raise arrhythmia susceptibility. This is a novel proarrhythmic mechanism that can increase arrhythmia susceptibility in structurally normal hearts within minutes and may, therefore, contribute to sudden cardiac death in diseases with increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity.},

The model predicts changes in excitation-contraction coupling 'gain' that result from diverse experimental interventions.

Specifically, the analysis suggests that many L-type Ca(2+) channel openings can potentially trigger each Ca(2+) spark, but the probability that an individual opening will trigger a spark is low. This procedure helps to reconcile contradictory results obtained in recent studies; moreover, this new model should be a useful tool for understanding changes in gain that occur physiologically and in disease.},

@article{Stern1992,
abstract = {The consequences of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by calcium-induced calcium release were studied theoretically, using a series of idealized models solved by analytic and numerical methods. "Common-pool" models, those in which the trigger calcium and released calcium pass through a common cytosolic pool, gave nearly all-or-none regenerative calcium releases (in disagreement with experiment), unless their loop gain was made sufficiently low that it provided little amplification of the calcium entering through the sarcolemma. In the linear (small trigger) limit, it was proven rigorously that no common-pool model can give graded high amplification unless it is operated on the verge of spontaneous oscillation. To circumvent this problem, we considered two types of "local-control" models. In the first type, the local calcium from a sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel directly stimulates a single, immediately opposed SR calcium release channel. This permits high amplification without regeneration, but requires high conductance of the SR channel. This problem is avoided in the second type of local control model, in which one L-type channel triggers a regenerative cluster of several SR channels. Statistical recruitment of clusters results in graded response with high amplification. In either type of local-control model, the voltage dependence of SR calcium release is not exactly the same as that of the macroscopic sarcolemmal calcium current, even though calcium is the only trigger for SR release. This results from the existence of correlations between the stochastic openings of individual sarcolemmal and SR channels. Propagation of regenerative calcium-release waves (under conditions of calcium overload) was analyzed using analytically soluble models in which SR calcium release was treated phenomenalogically. The range of wave velocities observed experimentally is easily explained; however, the observed degree of refractoriness to wave propagation requires either a strong dependence of SR calcium release on the rate of rise of cytosolic calcium or localization of SR release sites to one point in the sarcomere. We conclude that the macroscopic behavior of calcium-induced calcium release depends critically on the spatial relationships among sarcolemmal and SR calcium channels, as well as on their kinetics.},

abstract = {Atrial tachycardias are the most common cardiac arrhythmias in clinical practice, which induce changes in atrial properties that help to perpetuate them. These changes are called "atrial remodeling". Recent studies have shown that rapid ectopic activity principally on the pulmonary veins can trigger reentrant mechanisms and lead to atrial tachycardias. However, the influences of ectopic foci location, the number of ectopic beats and its frequency on the likelihood of triggering reentries are not well known. In this work the effects of electrical remodeling were incorporated in an atrial cell model and integrated in a three-dimensional model of human atria, to develop a study of vulnerability for reentries. To carry out the study, an ectopic beat and a burst of six ectopic beats at two different frequencies were applied in six different locations in the atria. The results show greater vulnerability in the left pulmonary veins when we applied a single ectopic beat. When we increase the number of ectopic beats to six, a greater width of the vulnerable window was observed when ectopic focus frequency was high. The location, the number of ectopic beats and their frequency affect the vulnerability for reentry.},

Reduction of [Na]0 from 140 mM to 14 mM produced a decrease of aiNa, and increase of free [Ca]i, and normally an increase of resting tension. 2. Inhibition of the Na-K pump by 10(-5) M acetyl-strophanthidin produced a slow rise of [Ca]i and resting tension. 3. The magnitude of the increase of free [Ca]i (and tension) produced by [Na]0 reduction was greatly enhanced when the Na-K pump is inhibited by either acetylstrophanthidin or K-free solutions. 4. We suggest that this enhanced rise of free [Ca]i in the presence of Na-K pump inhibition is due to Ca loading of intracellular Ca buffering systems during the pump inhibition. 5. Addition of NH4Cl produced a transient decrease of free [Ca]i that accompanied an alkaline change in pHi. Removal of NH4Cl (which produced a transient intracellular acidification) produced a transient increase of free [Ca]i. We conclude that a close relationship exists between the control of free [Ca]i and pHi which may be due to competition at, or common use of, intracellular buffering systems.},

Myocytes were attached to carbon fibre transducers and stretched, sarcomere length increased by approximately 9 \%, and there was a prolongation of the action potential duration. Streptomycin, a blocker of SACs, had no effect upon the shortening, [Ca2+]i transients or action potentials of electrically stimulated, unstretched myocytes, at a concentration of 50 $\mu$m, but at 40 $\mu$m, prevented any stretch-induced increase in action potential duration. Under action potential clamp, stretch elicited a current with a linear current-voltage relationship that was inward at membrane potentials negative to its reversal potential of −30 mV, in 10 of 24 cells tested, and was consistent with the activation of non-specific, cationic SACs. This current was not seen in any stretched cells that were exposed to 40 $\mu$m streptomycin. However, exposure of cells to 5 $\mu$m BAPTA-AM, in order to reduce [Ca2+]i transients, also abolished stretch-induced prolongation of the action potential. We conclude that both SACs and [Ca2+]i are important in the electrical response of cardiac myocytes to stretch, and propose that stretch-induced changes in electrical activity and [Ca2+]i may be linked by inter-dependent mechanisms.},

abstract = {Inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by mutations in ion channels that delay cardiac repolarization, increasing the risk of sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. Currently, the risk of sudden death in individuals with LQTS is estimated from clinical parameters such as age, gender, and the QT interval, measured from the electrocardiogram. Even though a number of different mutations can cause LQTS, mutation-specific information is rarely used clinically. LQTS type 1 (LQT1), one of the most common forms of LQTS, is caused by mutations in the slow potassium current (I(Ks)) channel $\alpha$ subunit KCNQ1. We investigated whether mutation-specific changes in I(Ks) function can predict cardiac risk in LQT1. By correlating the clinical phenotype of 387 LQT1 patients with the cellular electrophysiological characteristics caused by an array of mutations in KCNQ1, we found that channels with a decreased rate of current activation are associated with increased risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio=2.02), independent of the clinical parameters usually used for risk stratification. In patients with moderate QT prolongation (a QT interval less than 500 ms), slower activation was an independent predictor for cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, and sudden death) (hazard ratio = 2.10), whereas the length of the QT interval itself was not. Our results indicate that genotype and biophysical phenotype analysis may be useful for risk stratification of LQT1 patients and suggest that slow channel activation is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events.},

abstract = {A major challenge in computational biology is constraining free parameters in mathematical models. Adjusting a parameter to make a given model output more realistic sometimes has unexpected and undesirable effects on other model behaviors. Here, we extend a regression-based method for parameter sensitivity analysis and show that a straightforward procedure can uniquely define most ionic conductances in a well-known model of the human ventricular myocyte. The model's parameter sensitivity was analyzed by randomizing ionic conductances, running repeated simulations to measure physiological outputs, then collecting the randomized parameters and simulation results as "input" and "output" matrices, respectively. Multivariable regression derived a matrix whose elements indicate how changes in conductances influence model outputs. We show here that if the number of linearly-independent outputs equals the number of inputs, the regression matrix can be inverted. This is significant, because it implies that the inverted matrix can specify the ionic conductances that are required to generate a particular combination of model outputs. Applying this idea to the myocyte model tested, we found that most ionic conductances could be specified with precision (R(2) > 0.77 for 12 out of 16 parameters). We also applied this method to a test case of changes in electrophysiology caused by heart failure and found that changes in most parameters could be well predicted. We complemented our findings using a Bayesian approach to demonstrate that model parameters cannot be specified using limited outputs, but they can be successfully constrained if multiple outputs are considered. Our results place on a solid mathematical footing the intuition-based procedure simultaneously matching a model's output to several data sets. More generally, this method shows promise as a tool to define model parameters, in electrophysiology and in other biological fields.},

@article{Chudin1999,
abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF), the major cause of sudden cardiac death, is typically preceded by ventricular tachycardia (VT), but the mechanisms underlying the transition from VT to VF are poorly understood. Intracellular Ca(2+) overload occurs during rapid heart rates typical of VT and is also known to promote arrhythmias. We therefore studied the role of intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics in the transition from VT to VF, using a combined experimental and mathematical modeling approach. Our results show that 1) rapid pacing of rabbit ventricular myocytes at 35 degrees C led to increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels and complex patterns of action potential (AP) configuration and the intracellular Ca(2+) transients; 2) the complex patterns of the Ca(2+) transient arose directly from the dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+) cycling, and were not merely passive responses to beat-to-beat alterations in AP; 3) the complex Ca(2+) dynamics were simulated in a modified version of the Luo-Rudy (LR) ventricular action potential with improved intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics, and showed good agreement with the experimental findings in isolated myocytes; and 4) when incorporated into simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue, this action potential model produced a form of spiral wave breakup from VT to a VF-like state in which intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics played a key role through its influence on Ca(2+)-sensitive membrane currents such as I(Ca), I(NaCa), and I(ns(Ca)). To the extent that spiral wave breakup is useful as a model for the transition from VT to VF, these findings suggest that intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics may play an important role in the destabilization of VT and its degeneration into VF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational biology is a powerful tool for elucidating arrhythmogenic mechanisms at the cellular level, where complex interactions between ionic processes determine behavior. A novel theoretical model of the canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca2+ transient (CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca2+-release formulation, Ca2+ subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L)) reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na). CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This positive rate-dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell function.},

abstract = {Substrate depletion and increased intracellular acidity are believed to underlie clinically important manifestations of myocardial ischaemia. Recent advances in measuring ion concentrations and metabolite changes have provided a wealth of detail on the processes involved. Coupled with the rapid increase in computing power, this has allowed the development of a mathematical model of cardiac metabolism in normal and ischaemic conditions. Pre-existing models of cardiac cells such as Oxsoft HEART contain highly developed dynamic descriptions of cardiac electrical activity. While biophysically detailed, these models do not yet incorporate biochemical changes. Modelling of bioenergetic changes was based and verified against whole heart NMR spectroscopy. In the model, ATP hydrolysis and generation are calculated simultaneously as a function of [Pi]i. Simulation of pH regulation was based on the pHi dependency of acid efflux, examined in time-course studies of pHi recovery (measured in myocytes with the fluorophore carboxy-SNARF-1) from imposed acid and alkali loads. The force-[Ca2+]i relationship of myofibrils was used as the basis of modelling H+ competition with Ca2+, and thus of pH effects on contraction. This complex description of biochemically important changes in myocardial ischaemia was integrated into the OXSOFT models. The model is sufficiently complete to simulate calcium-overload arrhythmias during ischaemia and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. The timecourse of both metabolite and pH changes correlates well with clinical and experimental studies. The model possesses predictive power, as it aided the identification of electrophysiological effects of therapeutic interventions such as Na(+)-H+ block. It also suggests a strategy for the control of cardiac arrhythmias during calcium overload by regulating sodium-calcium exchange. In summary, we have developed a biochemically and biophysically detailed model that provides a novel approach to studying myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion.},

abstract = {Dogs have been used extensively to study atrial arrhythmias, but there are no published mathematical models of the canine atrial action potential (AP). To obtain insights into the ionic mechanisms governing canine atrial AP properties, we incorporated formulations of K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) currents, based on measurements in canine atrial myocytes, into a mathematical model of the AP. The rate-dependent behavior of model APs corresponded to experimental measurements and pointed to a central role for L-type Ca(2+) current inactivation in rate adaptation. Incorporating previously described regional ionic current variations into the model largely reproduced AP forms characteristic of the corresponding right atrial regions (appendage, pectinate muscle, crista terminalis, and atrioventricular ring). When ionic alterations induced by tachycardia-dependent remodeling were incorporated, the model reproduced qualitatively the AP features constituting the cellular substrate for atrial fibrillation. We conclude that this ionic model of the canine atrial AP agrees well with experimental measurements and gives potential insights into mechanisms underlying functionally important electrophysiological phenomena in canine atrium.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim was to test the hypothesis that in single guinea pig ventricular myocytes a large stretch induced increase in resting calcium was sensitive to the mechanosensitive channel blocker streptomycin. Methods: Carbon fibres were used to stretch cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator indo- 1. Force, sarcomere length, and internal calcium activity ( [Ca2+li) were measured. Results: In approximately 60\% of the cells studied, a stretch which increased sarcomere length by approximately 6\% caused a large increase in [Ca’+], (up to 60\% of the size of a [Ca”], transient at 0.25 Hz). When a mixture of antibiotics (streptomycin-penicillin) was used in solutions to isolate and store cells, this phenomenon was never observed (n = 19 cells). Direct application of physiological saline solution (PSS) could not reverse the increase in [Ca”], within 60 s of application (n = 7 cells). Direct application of penicillin [ 1000 IU per 50 ml (40 FM)] reversed the increase in [Ca”], within 60 s of application in only 3/7 cells. In contrast direct application of the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin (40 FM) rapidly reversed the large increase in [Ca2+li induced by stretch in each of 13 cells [within 18(SD 10) s of application]. Acute application of 40 FM streptomycin did not modify L-type Ca” currents measured under whole cell patch clamp conditions. Measurement of the resting tension - sarcomere length curves in cells stored in solution containing streptomycin and penicillin revealed two populations of cells on the basis of their stiffness. Conclusions: This stretch induced increase in [Ca”], may be associated with stretch activated arrhythmias in the heart. The effects of streptomycin are consistent with its reported inhibitory action on stretch activated channels.},

abstract = {The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60\% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30\% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure. Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+. These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery. The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis.},

A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to 're-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided. The source code, both for specific releases and the development version, is available to download under an open source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licence at http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste, together with details of a mailing list and links to documentation and tutorials.},

abstract = {The effects of acute global ischemia on cytosolic calcium transients were studied in perfused rabbit hearts loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator indo 1. Indo 1-loaded hearts were illuminated at 360 nm, and fluorescence was recorded simultaneously at 400 and 550 nm from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. The F400/F550 ratio was calculated by an analog circuit, which allowed cancellation of optical motion artifact. Resulting calcium transients demonstrated a rapid upstroke and slow decay similar to those recorded in isolated ventricular myocytes. Global ischemia rapidly suppressed contraction, but it produced a concurrent increase in the systolic and diastolic levels of the calcium transients, together with an increase in the duration of the peak. The effects of ischemia were reversed by reperfusion, inhibited by verapamil, and mimicked by perfusion of nonischemic hearts with acidified (CO2-rich) solution. In addition to elevation of the calcium transients, ischemia caused a pattern of intracellular calcium alternans that was discernible after 2-3 minutes. The pattern of alternans was stable at a given epicardial site, but it could be out of phase at different sites. Similar nonuniformities were observed in contraction strength and in the duration of monophasic action potentials recorded immediately adjacent to the fiber-optic probe. Abnormalities in intracellular calcium may be a causal factor in the loss of electrical and mechanical synchrony in the acutely ischemic heart.},

abstract = {Several mathematical models of rabbit ventricular action potential (AP) have been proposed to investigate mechanisms of arrhythmias and excitation-contraction coupling. Our study aims at systematically characterizing how ionic current properties modulate the main cellular biomarkers of arrhythmic risk using two widely-used rabbit ventricular models, and comparing simulation results using the two models with experimental data available for rabbit. A sensitivity analysis of AP properties, Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ dynamics, and their rate dependence to variations (±15\% and ±30\%) in the main transmembrane current conductances and kinetics was performed using the Shannon et al. (2004) and the Mahajan et al. (2008a,b) AP rabbit models. The effects of severe transmembrane current blocks (up to 100\%) on steady-state AP and calcium transients, and AP duration (APD) restitution curves were also simulated using both models. Our simulations show that, in both virtual rabbit cardiomyocytes, APD is significantly modified by most repolarization currents, AP triangulation is regulated mostly by the inward rectifier K⁺ current (I(K1)) whereas APD rate adaptation as well as [Na⁺](i) rate dependence is influenced by the Na⁺/K⁺ pump current (I(NaK)). In addition, steady-state [Ca²⁺](i) levels, APD restitution properties and [Ca²⁺](i) rate dependence are strongly dependent on I(NaK), the L-Type Ca²⁺ current (I(CaL)) and the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger current (I(NaCa)), although the relative role of these currents is markedly model dependent. Furthermore, our results show that simulations using both models agree with many experimentally-reported electrophysiological characteristics. However, our study shows that the Shannon et al. model mimics rabbit electrophysiology more accurately at normal pacing rates, whereas Mahajan et al. model behaves more appropriately at faster rates. Our results reinforce the usefulness of sensitivity analysis for further understanding of cellular electrophysiology and validation of cardiac AP models.},

abstract = {Quantifying the interactions between excitation and contraction is fundamental to furthering our understanding of cardiac physiology. To date simulating these effects in strongly coupled excitation and contraction tissue models has proved computationally challenging. This is in part due to the numerical methods implemented to maintain numerical stability in previous simulations, which produced computationally intensive problems. In this study, we analytically identify and quantify the velocity and length dependent sources of instability in the current established coupling method and propose a new method which addresses these issues. Specifically, we account for the length and velocity dependence of active tension within the finite deformation equations, such that the active tension is updated at each intermediate Newton iteration, within the mechanics solution step. We then demonstrate that the model is stable and converges in a three-dimensional rod under isometric contraction. Subsequently, we show that the coupling method can produce stable solutions in a cube with many of the attributes present in the heart, including asymmetrical activation, an inhomogeneous fibre field and a nonlinear constitutive law. The results show no instabilities and quantify the error introduced by discrete length updates. This validates our proposed coupling framework, demonstrating significant improvement in the stability of excitation and contraction simulations.},

abstract = {An interactive computer program, LabHEART, was developed to simulate the action potential (AP), ionic currents, and Ca handling mechanisms in a rabbit ventricular myocyte. User-oriented, its design allows switching between voltage and current clamp and easy on-line manipulation of key parameters to change the original formulation. The model reproduces normal rabbit ventricular myocyte currents, Ca transients, and APs. We also changed parameters to simulate data from heart failure (HF) myocytes, including reduced transient outward (I(to)) and inward rectifying K currents (I(K1)), enhanced Na/Ca exchange expression, and reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase function, but unaltered Ca current density. These changes caused reduced Ca transient amplitude and increased AP duration (especially at lower frequency) as observed experimentally. The model shows that the increased Na/Ca exchange current (I(NaCa)) in HF lowers the intracellular [Ca] threshold for a triggered AP from 800 to 540 nM. Similarly, the decrease in I(K1) reduces the threshold to 600 nM. Changes in I(to) have no effect. Combining enhanced Na/Ca exchange with reduced I(K1) (as in HF) lowers the threshold to trigger an AP to 380 nM. These changes reproduce experimental results in HF, where the contributions of different factors are not readily distinguishable. We conclude that the triggered APs that contribute to nonreentrant ventricular tachycardia in HF are due approximately equally (and nearly additively) to alterations in I(NaCa) and I(K1).

abstract = {Background—This study probes the cellular basis for the T wave under baseline and long-QT (LQT) conditions using an arterially perfused canine left ventricular (LV) wedge preparation, which permits direct temporal correlation of cellular transmembrane and ECG events. Methods and Results—Floating microelectrodes were used to record transmembrane action potentials (APs) simultaneously from epicardial, M-region, and endocardial sites or subendocardial Purkinje fibers. A transmural ECG was recorded concurrently. Under baseline and LQT conditions, repolarization of the epicardial action potential, the earliest to repolarize, coincided with the peak of the T wave; repolarization of the M cells, the last to repolarize, coincided with the end of the T wave. Thus, the action potential duration (APD) of the longest M cells determine the QT interval and the Tpeak–Tend interval serves as an index of transmural dispersion of repolarization. Repolarization of Purkinje fibers outlasted that of the M cell but failed to register on the ECG. The morphology of the T wave appeared to be due to currents flowing down voltage gradients on either side of the M region during phase 2 and phase 3 of the ventricular action potential. The interplay between these opposing forces determined the height of the T wave as well as the degree to which the ascending or descending limb of the T wave was interrupted, giving rise to bifurcated T waves and “apparent T-U complexes” under LQT conditions. Spontaneous and stimulation-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with characteristics of torsade de pointes (TdP) developed in the presence of dl-sotalol. Conclusions—Our results provide the first direct evidence that opposing voltage gradients between epicardium and the M region and endocardium and the M region contribute prominently to the inscription of the ECG T wave under normal conditions and to the widened or bifurcated T wave and long-QT interval observed under LQT conditions. Our data suggest that the “pathophysiological U” wave observed in acquired or congenital LQTS is more likely to be a second component of an interrupted T wave, and argue for use of the term T2 in place of U to describe this event.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have pointed out the controversy involving the arrhythmogenic effects of potassium channel openers (KCOs) in ischemia. KCOs activate the ATP-sensitive potassium current [IK(ATP)], resulting in action potential duration (APD) shortening, especially under pathological conditions such as ischemia. Acute myocardial ischemia leads to electrophysiological inhomogeneities in APD, conduction velocity, and refractoriness, which provide the substrate for reentry initiation and maintenance and may lead to malignant arrhythmias. The aim of this work is to analyze the effect of the KCO pinacidil on vulnerability to reentry during acute regional ischemia using computer simulations. We use a two-dimensional virtual heart tissue with implementation of acute regional ischemia conditions. Membrane kinetics are represented by a modified version of Luo-Rudy (phase II) action potential model that incorporates the effect of pinacidil on IK(ATP). The vulnerable window (VW) for reentry is quantified for different doses of pinacidil. Our results show that for doses below 3 micromol/l the VW widens with increasing pinacidil concentration, whereas for higher doses of pinacidil the VW decreases, becoming zero for concentrations above 10 micromol/l. The ionic mechanisms involved in this behavior are explored. This study demonstrates that the effect of pinacidil on arrhythmogenesis is strongly dose-dependent, and that high doses of pinacidil exert a strong antiarrhythmic effect.},

The coefficient of variation of the interbeat interval is quite small, approximately 2\%, even though the coefficient of variation of diastolic depolarization rate is approximately 15\%. It has been hypothesized that random fluctuations in interbeat interval arise from the stochastic behavior of the membrane ionic channels. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a single channel model of a single pacemaker cell isolated from the rabbit sinoatrial node, i.e., a model into which the stochastic open-close kinetics of the individual membrane ionic channels are incorporated. Single channel conductances as well as single channel open and closed lifetimes are based on experimental data from whole cell and single channel experiments that have been published in the past decade. Fluctuations in action potential parameters of the model cell are compared with those observed experimentally. It is concluded that fluctuations in interbeat interval of single sinoatrial node pacemaker cells indeed are due to the stochastic open-close kinetics of the membrane ionic channels.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop an isolated tissue model in which arrhythmic activity could be generated in response to conditions encountered in ischemia followed by reperfusion, and in which intracellular recordings could be used to identify and study arrhythmogenic mechanisms. Isolated canine Purkinje fiber-papillary muscle preparations were superfused with modified Tyrode's solutions. Tissues were exposed to conditions observed in ischemia (hypoxia, acidosis, elevated lactate, zero substrate for 40 minutes). Superfusion with Tyrode's solution of "normal" composition was then reinstituted. Transmembrane recordings from Purkinje and muscle tissues were made, using standard microelectrode techniques. Ischemic conditions caused loss of membrane potential, shortened action potentials, depressed excitability, and progressive bidirectional conduction block between muscle and Purkinje tissues. Spontaneous activity, probably reentrant in origin, was observed. Return to nonischemic conditions resulted in a multiphasic sequence of responses in Purkinje fibers: prompt hyperpolarization, progressive depolarization to unresponsiveness, and final repolarization to control. The depolarization phase was accompanied by oscillatory afterpotentials which initiated extrasystoles. Final repolarization included a phase of automaticity at low membrane potentials, during which Purkinje tissue functioned as a parasystolic focus. Elevation of potassium concentration to 10 mM during the ischemic period did not alter the sequence of electrophysiological events during ischemic conditions or upon reperfusion. This study demonstrates that ischemia followed by reperfusion elicits an orderly sequence of electrophysiological events which may constitute important mechanisms of arrhythmia in vivo.},

abstract = {External or internal application of proton on the calcium current was investigated using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in single ventricular cells of the guinea pig. The effect of acid pHo on the calcium current depended on the strength of the buffer in the internal solution. In the presence of 5 mM HEPES in the pipette, external acidification depressed calcium current with the half maximum inhibition of pHo 5.5. When the intracellular pH was buffered strongly to pH 7.2 by 50 mM HEPES within the pipette solution, half maximum inhibition of the calcium current was shifted to the acidic side markedly. When acid was applied in the patch electrode, calcium current was hardly affected by the pH values down to 6.0 in the pipette solution but was depressed by approximately half on further acidification to pH 4.5. When the Na+-H+ exchange system was blocked by superfusing the cell with either amiloride or Na+-deficient solutions (Tris substituted), calcium current was decreased by half at a pipette pH of around 6.5 and was completely and irreversibly blocked at pHpip 6.0.

abstract = {Although cardiac arrhythmia had long been considered a predominantly male syndrome, it is now clear that arrhythmia is also a primary cause of mortality in women. Notably, the manifestation of specific arrhythmia syndromes appears to be gender specific. In particular, female sex is an independent risk factor for development of torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias not only in congenital long QT syndromes but also in acquired long QT syndromes which occur as adverse effects of existing drugs. Males, on the other hand, are more likely to develop Brugada syndrome. Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that these differences may stem from intrinsic sex differences in cardiac tissue. These include fundamental electrical differences resulting from variable ion channel expression and diverse sex hormonal regulation via long-term genomic and acute nongenomic pathways, and sex differences in drug responses and metabolisms. Undoubtedly, determining the effect of gender on cardiac function will be difficult and require sophisticated methodologies. However, gender differences underlying predilection to distinct arrhythmia syndromes must be revealed so that new therapeutic strategies that take gender into account can be applied to at-risk patients.},

abstract = {Ion channels exhibit stochastic conformational changes determining their gating behavior. In addition, the process of protein turnover leads to a natural variability of the number of membrane and gap junctional channels. Nevertheless, in computational models, these two aspects are scarcely considered and their impacts are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of stochastic current fluctuations and channel distributions on action potential duration (APD), intercellular conduction delays (ICDs) and conduction blocks using a modified ventricular cell model (Rudy et al.) with Markovian formulations of the principal ion currents (to simulate their stochastic open-close gating behavior) and with channel counts drawn from Poisson distributions (to simulate their natural variability). In single cells, APD variability (coefficient of variation: 1.6\% at BCL=1000ms) was essentially caused by stochastic channel gating of I(Ks), persistent I(Na) and I(Ca,L). In cell strands, ICD variability induced by stochastic channel gating and Poissonian channel distributions was low under normal conditions. Nonetheless, at low intercellular coupling levels, Poissonian gap junctional channel distribution resulted in a large ICD variability (coefficient of variation >20\%), highly heterogeneous conduction patterns and conduction blocks. Therefore, the stochastic behavior of current fluctuations and channel distributions can contribute to the heterogeneity of conduction patterns and to conduction block, as observed previously in experiments in cardiac tissue with altered intercellular coupling.},

@article{Salata1996,
abstract = {The delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) in rabbit heart has long been thought to consist of only a single, rapidly activating, dofetilide-sensitive current, IKr. However, we find that IK of rabbit ventricular myocytes actually consists of both rapid and slow components, IKr and IKs, respectively, that can be isolated pharmacologically. Thus, after complete blockade of IKr with dofetilide, the remaining current, IKs, is homogeneous as judged by an envelope of tails test. IKs activates and deactivates slowly, continues to activate during sustained depolarizations, has a half-activation potential of 7.0 +/- 0.8 mV and slope factor of 11.0 +/- 0.7 mV, reverses at -77.2 +/- 1.3 mV (extracellular K+ concentration = 4 mM), is increased by removing extracellular K+, and is enhanced by isoproterenol and stocked by azimilide. Northern analysis demonstrates that the minK (IsK) gene, which encodes a subunit of the channel that underlies the IKs current, is expressed in rabbit heart. Expression of the rabbit protein in Xenopus oocytes elicits a slowly activating, voltage-dependent current, IsK, similar to those expressed previously from mouse, rat, guinea pig, and human genes. The results demonstrate that IKs is present in rabbit ventricle and therefore contributes to cardiac repolarization in this species.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the complex interactions between two major regulators of cardiac function; Ca2+ and stretch. Initial consideration is given to the effect of stretch on myocardial contractility and details the rapid and slow increases in contractility. These are shown to be related to two diverse changes in Ca2+ handling (enhanced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increased intracellular Ca2+ transient, respectively). Interaction between stretch and Ca2+ is also demonstrated with respect to the rhythm of cardiac contraction. Stretch has been shown to alter action potential configuration, generate stretch-activated arrhythmias, and increase the rate of beating of the sino-atrial node. A variety of Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms including attenuation of Ca2+ extrusion via Na+/Ca2+ exchange, Ca2+ entry through stretch-activated channels (SACs) and mobilisation of intracellular Ca2+ stores have been proposed to account for the effect of stretch on rhythm. Finally, the interaction between stretch and Ca2+ in the secretion of natriuretic peptides and onset of hypertrophy is discussed. Evidence is presented that Ca2+ (entering through L-type Ca2+ channels or SACs, or released from sarcoplasmic reticular stores) influences secretion of both atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide; there is data to support both positive and negative modulation by Ca2+. Ca2+ also appears to be important in the pathway that leads to expression of precursors of hypertrophic protein synthesis. In conclusion, two of the major regulators of cardiac muscle function, Ca2+ and stretch, interact to produce effects on the heart; in general these effects appear to be additive.},

When analysing the data of such cluster-randomized trials, a multilevel analysis should be applied in order to take into account the dependency of first-level units (i.e., subjects) within a second-level unit (i.e., a cluster). Moreover, the multilevel analysis can handle covariates on both levels. If a first-level covariate is involved, usually the within-cluster effect of this covariate will be estimated, implicitly assuming the contextual effect to be equal. However, this assumption may be violated. The focus of the present simulation study is the effects of ignoring the inequality of the within-cluster and contextual covariate effects on parameter and standard error estimates of the treatment effect, which is the parameter of main interest in experimental research. We found that ignoring the inequality of the within-cluster and contextual effects does not affect the estimation of the treatment effect or its standard errors. However, estimates of the variance components, as well as standard errors of the constant, were found to be biased.},

The aim of this brief review is to analyze such an interplay from two viewpoints: how membrane current sets membrane potential course and how membrane potential course may, in turn, affect individual channel activity. The outcome of this analysis leads to the general conclusion that considering the "dynamic" nature of membrane potential is of major importance in explaining the physiological and pharmacological modulation of the AP. To illustrate this conclusion, specific issues are discussed in the review including the applicability of the term "membrane resistance" under dynamic conditions, and the role of membrane potential velocity in determining "reverse rate-dependency" of drug effects on AP duration and in exposing "non-equilibrium" phenomena in channel gating.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Discordant alternans has the potential to produce larger alternans of the ECG T wave than concordant alternans, but its mechanism is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate by one- and two-dimensional simulation of action potential propagation models that discordant alternans can form spontaneously in spatially homogeneous tissue through one of two mechanisms, due to the interaction of conduction velocity and action potential duration restitution at high pacing frequencies or through the dispersion of diastolic interval produced by ectopic foci. In discordant alternans due to the first mechanism, the boundaries marking regions of alternans with opposite phase arise far from the stimulus site, move toward the stimulus site, and stabilize. Dynamic splitting of action potential duration restitution curves due to electrotonic coupling plays a crucial role in this stability. Larger tissues and faster pacing rates are conducive to multiple boundaries, and inhomogeneities of tissue properties facilitate or inhibit formation of boundaries. CONCLUSION: Spatial inhomogeneities of electrical restitution properties are not required to produce discordant alternans.},

However, little is known about how intra-SR Ca affects the release process. In this study we assessed how the fractional SR Ca release as described by Bassani et al. [Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Cell Physiol. 34): C533-C540, 1993] is affected by alteration of trigger Ca and of SR Ca content. Experiments were done with isolated ferret ventricular myocytes using indo 1 to measure Ca concentration, perforated patch to measure Ca current (ICa), caffeine application to release SR Ca, and thapsigargin to completely block SR Ca uptake. For what we consider a Normal SR Ca load and trigger Ca [action potential at 0.5 Hz with 2 mM extracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]o)], 35 +/- 3\% of the SR Ca content was released at a twitch. Changing trigger Ca by altering [Ca]o (to 0.5 and 8 mM) at a test twitch changed this fractional SR Ca release to 10 +/- 2 and 59 +/- 6\%, with the same SR Ca load (and peak ICa changed in a parallel manner in separate voltage-clamp experiments). Three different levels of SR Ca load were studied (Low, Normal, and High; by action potential stimulation at different frequencies from 0.05 to 0.8 Hz) using the same standard test trigger Ca (2 mM). Surprisingly, the High-load condition only increased SR Ca content by approximately 4\% but appeared to be very close to the limiting SR Ca capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In this paper we review and compare two recently developed mathematical models of the electrophysiology of canine ventricular myocytes. To clarify their similarities and differences, we also present studies using them in a range of preparations from single cells to two-dimensional tissue. The models are compared with each other and with new and previously published experimental results in terms of a number of their properties, including action potential morphologies; transmembrane currents during normal heart rates and during alternans; alternans onsets, magnitudes, and cessations; and reentry dynamics of spiral waves. Action potential applets and spiral wave movies for the two canine ventricular models are available online as supplemental material. We find a number of differences between the models, including their rate dependence, alternans dynamics, and reentry stability, and a number of differences compared with experiments. Differences between models of the same species and region of the heart are not unique to these canine models. Similar differences can be found in the behavior of two models of human ventricular myocytes and of human atrial myocytes. We provide several possible explanations for the differences observed in models of the same species and region of the heart and discuss the implications for the applicability of models in addressing questions of mechanism in cardiac electrophysiology.},

abstract = {Impulse propagation across sudden expansions of excitable tissue has been shown to exhibit various forms of conduction disturbance on a macroscopic scale, ranging from small delays to unidirectional or complete conduction block. With the present study, we attempted to characterize systematically the dependence of impulse propagation on the geometry of the underlying excitable tissue on a microscopic scale by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern of transmembrane voltage changes associated with impulse propagation from a narrow cell strand to a large cell area using multiple site optical recording of transmembrane voltage (MSORTV) in conjunction with patterned growth of neonatal rat heart cells in culture. While action potential propagation was smooth in the case of funneled expansions, delays of variable size occurred during propagation into rectangular or incised expansions. Close to the abrupt expansion, which functionally represented an increased electrical load to the narrow cell strand, the delays were accompanied by marked distortions of the action potential upstroke, exhibiting, in extreme cases, an initial depolarization to 50\% followed by a delayed secondary depolarization to 100\% of the full-signal amplitude. These distortions, which were based on bidirectional electrotonic interactions across the transition, were maximal immediately downstream from the expansion. The maximal slowing of impulse conduction across abrupt expansions was, in agreement with recently published results obtained from two-dimensional computer simulations, always situated in the expanded region. At high stimulation rates, the delays sometimes turned into intermittent unidirectional blocks, as revealed by reverse stimulation. These blocks were always characterized by a marked abbreviation of the action potentials upstream from the region causing the block which might, in an appropriate network, facilitate reentry because of the associated shortening of the refractory period. Because the patterns were composed of cells having identical membrane properties, the results show that the local action potential shape can be modulated profoundly by the two-dimensional architecture of the underlying cell ensemble alone.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of ischemia on transmembrane action potentials, conduction time, and refractory periods of both endocardial and epicardial muscle cells of coronary-perfused cat left ventricles. Oxygenated Tyrode's solution was perfused through the left anterior descending coronary artery, while the preparation was superfused with Tyrode's solution gassed with 95\% N2 and 5\% CO2. Transmembrane action potentials recorded simultaneously from endocardial and epicardial cells were normal during coronary perfusion. When perfusion was discontinued ("ischemia"), rapid deterioration of action potentials and prolongation of conduction time were observed in both endocardial and epicardial cells. The magnitude of the reduction of action potential amplitude and action potential duration (APD), and of prolongation of conduction time, was greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells, although the change in resting membrane potential was almost the same. However, APD of endocardial cells decreased progressively during 30 min of ischemia, whereas APD of epicardial cells was reduced maximally at 10 min and then partially recovered. Shortening of refractory periods of endocardial cells paralleled APD shortening, whereas refractory periods of epicardial cells decreased for the first 10 min and then increased. At 10 min of ischemia, APD and refractory periods of epicardial cells were significantly shorter than those of endocardial cells. At 30 min of ischemia, refractory periods of epicardial cells exceeded those of endocardial cells because of development of greater postrepolarization refractoriness in epicardial cells. Accompanying these different changes in APD and refractory periods of endocardial and epicardial cells, spontaneous extrasystolic impulses increased and rapid runs of extrasystolic impulses could be induced by extrastimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Cardiac Cellular Electrophysiology is intended for the clinical cardiologist who wishes to refresh or deepen his understanding of the cellular basis of cardiac electrophysiology, for researchers interested in the basis of the electrical activity of the heart, such as clinical investigators, physiologists or pharmacologists, for teachers in physiology, pharmacology and other biomedical studies, and for medical students from graduate to postgraduate level. Cardiac Cellular Electrophysiology starts with a primer of basic electrophysiology, the cardiac action potential and the physiological basis of the electrocardiogram. Our second aim after having introduced the basic concepts was to continue with giving an overview of the properties of the most important ionic currents in the heart, and to treat their modulation, in order to deal with the mechanisms underlying cardiac ischaemia, arrhythmias and remodelling. Edward Carmeliet and Johan Vereecke, Katholieke University Leuven, Belgium, have collaborated for over 30 years in cardiac electrophysiology research. Their studies include the genesis of the normal action potential, its changes in ischaemia, the effect of drugs, and the mechanism of arrhythmias, using techniques from the classic potential registration with intracellular microelectrodes to whole cell clamp and single channel measurements.},

abstract = {The relative influence of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor activation in eliciting early (EADs) and delayed (DADs) after depolarizations was assessed using intracellular microelectrode recordings in isolated adult canine ventricular myocytes. Normoxic myocytes were exposed to the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) or the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-6) M) during pacing at different frequencies (0.5-4 Hz). alpha-Adrenergic stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent prolongation of action potential duration but failed to induce either EADs or DADs. beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol at low concentrations (10(-9)-10(-8) M) induced a prolongation of the action potential, whereas higher concentrations (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) resulted in a marked shortening. Isoproterenol elicited single or multiple (2-5) DADs at concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, with a corresponding increase in the amplitude of the DADs and decrease in the coupling interval as cells were paced at increasing rates. DADs often initiated and maintained sustained triggered rhythms that spontaneously terminated. Isoproterenol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) also elicited EADs in 80\% of cells at the highest concentration utilized (10(-6) M) and at intermediate pacing frequencies (1-2 Hz). EADs often occurred with a 2:1 or 3:1 pattern. EADs and DADs induced by isoproterenol were reversibly abolished by low extracellular sodium, ryanodine (10(-6) M), or benzamil (10(-4) M), thus indicating that Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and extracellular Na+ concentration are two major factors in the development of both types of afterdepolarizations. The demonstration that EADs can be induced by isoproterenol in ventricular muscle suggest a novel pathway for beta-adrenergic receptors to mediate arrhythmogenesis in the intact heart.},

Reperfusion of the 60 min ischemic hearts resulted in incomplete recovery of contractile function and calcium uptake activities of both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. On the other hand, reperfusion of the 90 min ischemic hearts further depressed the microsomal Ca2+ uptake activity. Coronary occlusion for 90 min in dog hearts was found to decrease microsomal Ca2+-pump and sarcolemmal Na+-K+ ATPase activities. Reperfusion of these regional ischemic hearts further depressed the microsomal Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase as well as sarcolemmal Na+-K+ ATPase activities whereas mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was increased. Perfusion of rat hearts for 60 min with hypoxic medium resulted in depression of the sarcolemmal Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake and ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activities. Reperfusion of these hypoxic hearts failed to recover the sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+-pump activities. These results demonstrate that membrane defects with respect to Ca2+ transport processes in ischemic/hypoxic hearts may be associated with irreversible injury.},

The effects of this blood on transmembrane potentials of muscle strips taken from the same heart were compared with control blood. Whereas action potentials remained stable in control blood, ischemic blood collected after more than 15 minutes of coronary occlusion produced shortening of action potential duration, reduction of resting potential, upstroke velocity and amplitude, then postrepolarization refractoriness and finally unresponsiveness. Ischemic blood collected after shorter periods of coronary occlusion produced only mild effects (shortening of action potential and postrepolarization refractoriness). These effects of ischemic blood could not be attributed to increased potassium concentration even in combination with acidosis, hypoxia and hypoglycemia. It appears that during ischemia unidentified factors are released which have potent depressant effects on the excitability of even normal myocardium.},

abstract = {Changes in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, mediate excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and contribute to cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion. To study these processes directly, we measured [Ca2+]i in perfused ferret (Mustela putorius furo) hearts using 19F NMR spectroscopy to detect the 5,5'-difluoro derivative of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). To load cells, hearts were perfused with the acetoxymethyl ester derivative of 5,5'-F2-BAPTA. We measured 19F NMR spectra and left ventricular pressure simultaneously, at rest and during pacing at various external Ca concentrations [( Ca]o). Although contractile force was attenuated by the Ca2+ buffering properties of 5,5'-F2-BAPTA, the decrease in pressure could be overcome by raising [Ca]o. Our mean value of 104 nM for [Ca2+]i at rest in the perfused heart agrees well with previous measurements in isolated ventricular muscle. During pacing at 0.6-4 Hz, time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased; the effect of pacing was augmented by increasing [Ca]o. [Ca2+]i more than tripled during 10-20 min of global ischemia, and returned toward control levels upon reperfusion. This approach promises to be particularly useful in investigating the physiology of intact hearts and the pathophysiology of alterations in the coronary circulation.},

@article{Lawrence2005,
abstract = {Prolongation of the QT interval and the cardiac action potential have been linked to a potentially fatal but rare tachyarrhythmia known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Nonclinical assays, such as those investigating the effect on I(Kr) (the hERG channel current), prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and the QT interval, in vivo, have been developed to predict the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP in man. However, there seems to be a dissociation between the risk of QT interval prolongation and the torsadogenic risk. There is an increasing mass of evidence showing that an increase in the QT interval does not necessarily lead to TdP. Thus, it appears that while standard assays are very good, although perhaps not infallible, at predicting the risk of QT interval prolongation in man they do not predict the proarrhythmic risk. Recently there has been a plethora of publications suggesting that there are electrophysiological markers associated with drug-induced TdP other than hERG channel activity, APD and the QT interval, and these markers may be better predictors of TdP. In this review, three in vitro and, briefly, three in vivo models or methods are discussed. These proarrhythmia models use electrophysiological markers such as transmural dispersion of repolarization, action potential triangulation, instability, reverse use-dependence, and the incidence of early after-depolarizations to predict the risk of TdP. Most of the models presented have been published widely. The particular variable or set of variables used by each model to predict the torsadogenic propensity of a drug has been reported to correlate with clinical outcome. While each variable/model has been shown to discriminate between antiarrhythmic and nonarrhythmic drugs, these reports should be interpreted cautiously since none has been independently (externally) assessed. Each model is discussed along with its particular merits and shortcomings; none, as yet, having shown a predictive value that makes it clearly superior to the others. Proarrhythmia models, in particular in vitro models, challenge current perceptions of appropriate surrogates for TdP in man and question existing nonclinical strategies for assessing proarrhythmic risk. The rapid emergence of such models, compounded by the lack of a clear understanding of the key proarrhythmic mechanisms has resulted in a regulatory reluctance to embrace such models. The wider acceptance of proarrhythmia models is likely to occur when there is a clear understanding and agreement on the key proarrhythmia mechanisms. Regardless of regulatory acceptance, with further validation these models may still enhance pharmaceutical company decision-making to provide a rational basis for drug progression, particularly in areas of unmet medical need.},

abstract = {Propagation of the action potential is a complex process, and the relationships among the various factors involved in conduction have not been clear. We use three mathematical models of uniform conduction in a cable to clarify some of these relationships. One model is newly derived here, and two have been previously derived by Hunter et al. (1975, Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol., 30:99-144). These models were able to simulate individual experimental action potential upstrokes previously obtained (Walton and Fozzard, 1983, Biophys. J., 44:1-8). The models were then utilized to provide relationships between measures of conduction. Among these were that maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax) is directly proportional to peak inward ionic current normalized by capacitance that is filled during the upstroke (I/Cf), and that conduction velocity was directly related to the square root of either Vmax or I/Cf. These relationships were shown to be model independent and to predict the experimental results, thus providing validated quantitative relationships that were not discernible through use of experimental data alone. The concept of safety factor was considered and a parameter was proposed that may be related to safety factor.},

abstract = {The rate of decline of free intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]i) is a potentially useful index of the function of Ca transport systems. However, interpretations of these results may depend on multiple Ca transport systems and interaction with intracellular Ca binding sites. We measured [Ca]i in voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes isolated from rat hearts using indo 1 fluorescence. Conditions were chosen where [Ca]i decline was expected to depend almost exclusively on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca pump. The half time of [Ca]i decline (t1/2) decreased as the amplitude of the intracellular Ca (Cai) transient increased. This is not the result that would be expected from a transport system where the transport rate is a linear function of free [Ca]i. In this case the time constant of [Ca]i decline (tau) should be independent of the peak value of [Ca]i. This is also true if linear buffering of Cai is included. We develop a simple but more realistic theoretical framework where Ca transport rate and Ca binding both depend on free [Ca]i with Michaelis-Menten type functions. We demonstrate that the observed decline in apparent tau with increasing peak [Ca]i is entirely expected on theoretical grounds and over a wide range of characteristics for Ca transport and binding. We conclude that one cannot draw inferences about the intrinsic Ca transport function based on tau values unless the Cai transient has a comparable size.},

@article{Antzelevitch2007,
abstract = {This lecture examines the hypothesis that amplification of spatial dispersion of repolarization in the form of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited ion channelopathies, including the long QT, short QT, and Brugada syndromes as well as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In the long QT syndrome, amplification of TDR often is secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration of M cells, whereas in Brugada syndrome, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the action potential duration of right ventricular epicardium. In the short QT syndrome, preferential abbreviation of action potential duration of either endocardium or epicardium appears to be responsible for amplification of TDR. In catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, reversal of the direction of activation of the ventricular wall is responsible for the increase in TDR. Thus, the long QT, short QT, Brugada, and catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia syndromes are pathologies with very different phenotypes and etiologies. However, these syndromes share a common final pathway in their predisposition to sudden cardiac death.},

The rapid reperfusion after coronary occlusion has considerably improved the cardiac outcome, however reperfusion per se has deleterious effect also called reperfusion injuries. Cytosolic calcium overload is now well admitted as an essential pathophysiological mechanism involved in reperfusion injuries although the source and origin of calcium remain to be determined. Recent works have pointed out the potential defect of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels (ryanodine receptor, RyR) as a primary cause of calcium overload during ischemia-reperfusion. This finding opens new pharmacological perspectives in limiting reperfusion injuries since allosteric modulators able to restore and prevents RyR dysfunction have been developed during the last decade.},

@article{Allen1983,
abstract = {Papillary muscles from rats, cats and ferrets were microinjected with aequorin, a photoprotein which emits light as a function of Ca2+ concentration. The effects of hypoxia and different types of metabolic inhibition on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([ Ca2+]i) and tension were studied. 2. Exposure of the muscle to hypoxia (PO2 less than 5 mmHg) or CN- caused a reversible decrease in developed tension, with no change in the magnitude of the Ca transient associated with each contraction. The rate of decline of the Ca transient was decreased slightly but significantly during these interventions. 3. In half the preparations examined, the initial fall in tension produced by hypoxia was interrupted by a short-lived increase in developed tension. No change in the Ca transient was associated with this increase in tension. 4. After exposure of papillary muscles to glucose-free Tyrode solution for short periods (less than 1 hr), hypoxia and CN- had a similar effect on the magnitude of the light transient and developed tension to section 2 above. After perfusion with glucose-free Tyrode solution for longer periods (greater than 2 hr), hypoxia and CN- caused a greater decrease in developed tension and a marked decrease in the magnitude of the Ca transient. 5. The addition of CN- to papillary muscles which were superfused with Tyrode solution containing 2-deoxyglucose instead of glucose, caused a rapid decrease in the magnitude of the Ca transient and of developed tension. These changes were not fully reversible. 6. In muscles which developed an hypoxic contracture, the resting [Ca2+]i did not rise by more than a factor of 1.4. 7. It is concluded that when glycolysis can proceed, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation results in a decrease in developed tension with no change in the magnitude of the Ca transient. This decrease in the apparent sensitivity of the contractile proteins to Ca2+ is attributable to the decrease in intracellular pH known to occur in this situation. There may also be a second mechanism tending to reduce the Ca transient under these conditions. 8. During inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, developed tension falls as a result of decreased Ca transients. This could be because the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP falls below the level required to pump Ca from the myoplasm to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {In view of the critical role of sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) Ca(2+) release and the Ca(2+) pump in cardiac contraction-relaxation, this study was undertaken to assess the status of SR function, protein content, and gene expression in isolated rat hearts subjected to global ischemia for 30 min followed by 60 min of reperfusion (I/R). Attenuated recovery of contractile function in the I/R hearts was associated with reduced SR Ca(2+) uptake, Ca(2+) release, and ryanodine-binding activities. mRNA levels and protein contents for SR Ca(2+) pump ATPase and Ca(2+) release channels were markedly depressed in the I/R hearts. Perfusion of hearts with superoxide dismutase plus catalase, well-known scavengers of oxyradicals, prevented the I/R-induced alterations in cardiac function and partially prevented SR Ca(2+) transport activities and mRNA abundance. In hearts perfused with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or H(2)O(2), changes similar to those in the I/R hearts were observed. These results indicate that oxyradicals may participate in depressing the SR Ca(2+) handling and gene expression in the I/R heart. It is suggested that treatment of hearts with antioxidants may improve the recovery of cardiac function by preserving the SR function and partially protecting the SR gene expression.},

abstract = {Most neurons have large numbers of voltage- and time-dependent currents that contribute to their electrical firing patterns. Because these currents are nonlinear, it can be difficult to determine the role each current plays in determining how a neuron fires. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of decapod crustaceans has been studied extensively biophysically. We constructed approximately 600,000 versions of a four-compartment model of the LP neuron and distributed 11 different currents into the compartments. From these, we selected approximately 1300 models that match well the electrophysiological properties of the biological neuron. Interestingly, correlations that were seen in the expression of channel mRNA in biological studies were not found across the approximately 1300 admissible LP neuron models, suggesting that the electrical phenotype does not require these correlations. We used cubic fits of the function from maximal conductances to a series of electrophysiological properties to ask which conductances predominantly influence input conductance, resting membrane potential, resting spike rate, phasing of activity in response to rhythmic inhibition, and several other properties. In all cases, multiple conductances contribute to the measured property, and the combinations of currents that strongly influence each property differ. These methods can be used to understand how multiple currents in any candidate neuron interact to determine the cell's electrophysiological behavior.},

abstract = {Visual clutter denotes a disordered collection of graphical entities in information visualization. It can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset, visual clutter makes it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this thesis, I study visual clutter with four distinct visualization techniques, and present the concept and framework of Clutter-Based Dimension Reordering (CBDR). Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualiza- tion’s expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing data content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this thesis, I apply the CBDR framework to four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, I determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties, then design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display. Finally I search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display. Different algorithms for the searching process are discussed in this thesis as well. In order to gather users’ responses toward the clutter measures used in the Clutter-Based Dimension Reordering process and validate the usefulness of CBDR, I also conducted an evaluation with two groups of users. The study result proves that users find our approach to be helpful for visually exploring datasets. The users also had many comments and suggestions for the CBDR approach as well as for visual clutter reduction in general. The content and result of the user study are included in this thesis.},

Membrane action potentials and pace-maker activity were calculated and compared with time course of underlying changes in two functionally distinct outeard currents, iX1 and iK2. 3. The repolarization of the theoretical action potential is triggered by the onset of iX1, which becomes activated over the plateau range of potentials. iK2 also activates during the plateau but does not play a controlling role in the repolarization. Hwever, iK2 does govern the slow pace-maker depolarization through its subsequent deactivation at negative potentials. 4. The individual phases of the calculated action potential and their 'experimental' modifications were compared with published records. The upstroke is generated by a Hodgkin-Huxley type sodium conductance (gNa), and rises with a maximum rate of 478 V/sec, somewhat less than experimentally observed values ( up to 800 V/sec). The discrepancy is discussed in relation to experimental attempts at measuring gNa. 5.

Models have evolved from mathematical descriptions of ionic channels alone to more sophisticated formulations that include calcium transport mechanisms, ATP production and metabolic pathways. The increased complexity is fueled by the new data available in the field. The continuous production of experimental data has led to the evolution of increasingly refined descriptions of the phenomena by modelers. Integrating the numerous systems involved in cardiac myocyte homeostasis makes the use of computer models necessary due to the unreliability of intuitive approaches. However the complexity of the model should not imply a cumbersome operation of the program. As with any tool, computer models have to be easy to operate or their strength will be diminished and potential users will not benefit fully from them. The contribution of the computer modeler to their respective biological fields will be more successful and enduring if modelers devote sufficient time to implement their equations into a model with user-friendly characteristics.},

Steady-state action po- tential duration (APD), conduction times, refractory periods, and dispersion of action potential durations were determined during programmed stimulation and during 50-Hz burst stimuli, and related to arrhythmia inducibility. Amiodarone prolonged APD by 12 to 15 ms at pacing cycle lengths of 300 to 600 ms (p0.05) but did not significantly increase conduction times or dispersion of APD. Amiodarone prolonged refractoriness more than action potential duration, resulting in PRR (refractory pe- riodAPD at 90\% repolarization, 1410 ms, p0.05 versus controls). PRR curtailed the initial sloped part of the APD res- titution curve by 20\%. During burst stimulation, pronounced amiodarone-induced PRR (40  15 ms, p  0.05 versus con- trols) reduced the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias (p  0.05 versus controls). Furthermore, in 35\% of bursts only monomorphic ventricular tachycardias and no longer ventricu- lar fibrillation were inducible in amiodarone-treated hearts (p  0.05 versus controls). Chronic amiodarone treatment prevents ventricular tachycardias by inducing PRR without much con- duction slowing, thereby curtailing the initial part of APD resti- tution. PRR without conduction slowing is a desirable feature of drugs designed to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology are an important component of the Cardiac Physiome Project, which is an international effort to build biophysically based multi-scale mathematical models of the heart. Models of tissue electrophysiology can provide a bridge between electrophysiological cell models at smaller scales, and tissue mechanics, metabolism and blood flow at larger scales. This paper is a critical review of cardiac tissue electrophysiology models, focussing on the micro-structure of cardiac tissue, generic behaviours of action potential propagation, different models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology, the choice of parameter values and tissue geometry, emergent properties in tissue models, numerical techniques and computational issues. We propose a tentative list of information that could be included in published descriptions of tissue electrophysiology models, and used to support interpretation and evaluation of simulation results. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions.},

abstract = {Regional heterogeneities of ventricular repolarizing currents and their role in arrhythmogenesis have received much attention; however, relatively little is known regarding heterogeneities of intracellular calcium handling. Because repolarization properties and contractile function are heterogeneous from base to apex of the intact heart, we hypothesize that calcium handling is also heterogeneous from base to apex. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel ratiometric optical mapping system capable of measuring calcium fluorescence of indo-1 at two separate wavelengths from 256 sites simultaneously. With the use of intact Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts, ratiometric calcium transients were recorded under normal conditions and during administration of known inotropic agents. Ratiometric calcium transients were insensitive to changes in excitation light intensity and fluorescence over time. Under control conditions, calcium transient amplitude near the apex was significantly larger (60\%, P < 0.01) compared with the base. In contrast, calcium transient duration was significantly longer (7.5\%, P < 0.03) near the base compared with the apex. During isoproterenol (0.05 microM) and verapamil (2.5 microM) administration, ratiometric calcium transients accurately reflected changes in contractile function, and, the direction of base-to-apex heterogeneities remained unchanged compared with control. Ratiometric optical mapping techniques can be used to accurately quantify heterogeneities of calcium handling in the intact heart. Significant heterogeneities of calcium release and sequestration exist from base to apex of the intact heart. These heterogeneities are consistent with base-to-apex heterogeneities of contraction observed in the intact heart and may play a role in arrhythmogenesis under abnormal conditions.},

abstract = {Whole cell currents were measured in isolated cardiocytes of guinea pig under anoxic conditions (pO2 less than 0.5 torr). After 2 to 32 (mean 11.2) minutes of anoxia, time independent outward currents developed gradually which had a linear current-voltage relation between -100 and +20 mV and reversed at the resting potential of the cells (-82 to -90 mV). After 20 to 170 (mean 38) seconds, the amplitude of these outward currents saturated (3.6 +/- 0.5 nA at +10 mV, n = 23). Reoxygenation within one minute after the appearance of the first extra outward currents led in most cells (greater than 90\%) to their complete disappearance in 2 to 4 (mean 2.87, n = 15) seconds. Ca currents were not affected at the time when the first extra outward currents occurred. It is concluded that (i) the anoxia-induced outward current is carried by K+ ions probably through KATP channels which open at intracellular ATP concentrations below 1 mmol/l (Noma and Shibasaki 1985) and (ii) this degree of ATP depletion does not affect normal Ca channel function.},

abstract = {Defining the cellular electrophysiological mechanisms for ventricular tachyarrhythmias is difficult, given the wide array of potential mechanisms, ranging from abnormal automaticity to various types of reentry and kk activity. The degree of difficulty is increased further by the fact that any particular mechanism may be influenced by the evolving ionic and anatomic environments associated with many forms of heart disease. Consequently, static measures of a single electrophysiological characteristic are unlikely to be useful in establishing mechanisms. Rather, the dynamics of the electrophysiological triggers and substrates that predispose to arrhythmia development need to be considered. Moreover, the dynamics need to be considered in the context of a system, one that displays certain predictable behaviors, but also one that may contain seemingly stochastic elements. It also is essential to recognize that even the predictable behaviors of this complex nonlinear system are subject to small changes in the state of the system at any given time. Here we briefly review some of the short-, medium-, and long-term alterations of the electrophysiological substrate that accompany myocardial disease and their potential impact on the initiation and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias. We also provide examples of cases in which small changes in the electrophysiological substrate can result in rather large differences in arrhythmia outcome. These results suggest that an interrogation of cardiac electrical dynamics is required to provide a meaningful assessment of the immediate risk for arrhythmia development and for evaluating the effects of putative antiarrhythmic interventions.},

In addition, the frequency-dependent relative contribution of SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange for cytosolic Ca(2+)-removal was assessed by paired RCCs. With increasing rest intervals (1-240 s) post-rest twitch force and RCC amplitude decreased monotonically in rabbit myocardium (after 240 s by 45+/-10\% and 61+/-11\%, respectively P<0. 05, n=14). In contrast, rat myocardium (n=11) exhibited a parallel increase in post-rest twitch force (by 67+/-16\% at 240 s P<0.05) and RCC amplitude (by 20+/-14\%P<0.05). In rabbit myocardium (n=11), increasing stimulation frequency from 0.25 to 3 Hz increased twitch force by 295+/-50\% (P<0.05) and RCC amplitude by 305+/-80\% (P<0.05). In contrast, in rat myocardium (n=6), twitch force declined by 43+/-7\% (P<0.05), while RCC amplitude decreased only insignificantly (by 16+/-7\%). The SR Ca(2+)-uptake relative to Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange (based on paired RCCs) increased progressively with frequency in rabbit, but not in rat myocardium (;66+/-2\% at all frequencies). We conclude that increased SR Ca(2+)-load contributes to the positive force-frequency relationship in rabbits and post-rest potentiation of twitch force in rats. Decreased SR Ca(2+)-load contributes to post-rest decay of twitch force in rabbits, but may play only a minor role in the negative force-frequency relationship in rats. SR Ca(2+)-release channel refractoriness may contribute importantly to the negative force-frequency relationship in rat and recovery from refractoriness may contribute to post-rest potentiation.},

abstract = {In cardiac myocytes Ca2+ cross-signaling between Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors takes place by exchange of Ca2+ signals in microdomains surrounding dyadic junctions, allowing first the activation and then the inactivation of the two Ca2+-transporting proteins. To explore the details of Ca2+ signaling between the two sets of receptors we measured the two-dimensional cellular distribution of Ca2+ at 240 Hz by using a novel confocal imaging technique. Ca2+ channel-triggered Ca2+ transients could be resolved into dynamic "Ca2+ stripes" composed of hundreds of discrete focal Ca2+ releases, appearing as bright fluorescence spots (radius congruent with 0.5 micrometer) at reproducible sites, which often coincided with t-tubules as visualized with fluorescent staining of the cell membrane. Focal Ca2+ releases triggered stochastically by Ca2+ current (ICa) changed little in duration ( congruent with7 ms) and size (congruent with100,000 Ca ions) between -40 and +60 mV, but their frequency of activation and first latency mirrored the kinetics and voltage dependence of ICa. The resolution of 0.95 +/- 0. 13 reproducible focal Ca2+ release sites per micrometer3 in highly Ca2+-buffered cells, where diffusion of Ca2+ is limited to 50 nm, suggests the presence of about one independent, functional Ca2+ release site per half sarcomere. The density and distribution of Ca2+ release sites suggest they correspond to dyadic junctions. The abrupt onset and termination of focal Ca2+ releases indicate that the cluster of ryanodine receptors in individual dyadic junctions may operate in a coordinated fashion.},

If the state transition density is log-concave and the observation model satisfies certain standard assumptions, then the optimization problem is strictly concave and can be solved rapidly with Newton-Raphson methods, because the Hessian of the loglikelihood is block tridiagonal. We can further exploit this block-tridiagonal structure to develop efficient parameter estimation methods for these models.

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) underlie the upstroke of the action potential in the excitable tissues of nerve and muscle. After opening, NaVs rapidly undergo inactivation, a crucial process through which sodium conductance is negatively regulated. Disruption of inactivation by inherited mutations is an established cause of lethal cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or painful syndromes. Intracellular calcium ions (Ca2þ) modulate sodium channel inactivation, and multiple players have been suggested in this process, including the cytoplasmic NaV C-terminal region including two EF-hands and an IQ motif, the NaV domain III-IV linker, and calmodulin. Calmodulin can bind to the IQ domain in both Ca2þ-bound and Ca2þ-free condi- tions, but only to the DIII-IV linker in a Ca2þ-loaded state. The mechanism of Ca2þ regulation, and its composite effect(s) on channel gating, has been shrouded in much controversy owing to numerous apparent experimental inconsistencies. Herein, we attempt to summarize these disparate data and propose a novel, to our knowledge, physiological mechanism whereby calcium ions promote sodium current facilitation due to Ca2þ memory at high-action-potential frequencies where Ca2þ levels may accumulate. The available data suggest that this phenomenon may be disrupted in diseases where cytoplasmic calcium ion levels are chronically high and where targeted phosphorylation may decouple the Ca2þ regulatory machinery. Many NaV disease mutations associated with electrical dysfunction are located in the Ca2þ-sensing machinery and misregulation of Ca2þ-dependent channel modulation is likely to contribute to disease phenotypes.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of the human atria myocyte based on averaged voltage-clamp data recorded from isolated single myocytes. Our model consists of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type equivalent circuit for the sarcolemma, coupled with a fluid compartment model, which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm as well as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This formulation can reconstruct action potential data that are representative of recordings from a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic currents. This work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit atrium. We have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward K+ current (I[sus]), which putatively has a prominent role in determining the duration of the human atrial action potential. Our results demonstrate that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases is determined primarily by transient outward K+ current, I(sus) and L-type Ca2+ current (I[Ca,L]) and that the role of I(sus) in the human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes of I(Ca,L), I(sus) and the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current. As a result, our simulations suggest that the functional role of I(sus) can depend on the physiological/disease state of the cell.},

abstract = {Myocardial ischemia results in metabolic changes, which collapse the mitochondrial network, that increase the vulnerability of the heart to ventricular fibrillation (VF). It has been demonstrated at the single cell level that uncoupling the mitochondria using carbonyl cyanide p-(tri-fluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) at low concentrations can be cardioprotective. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of FCCP on arrhythmogenesis during ischemia in the whole rabbit heart. We performed optical mapping of isolated rabbit hearts (n = 33) during control and 20 min of global ischemia and reperfusion, both with and without pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP at 100, 50, or 30 nM. No hearts went into VF during ischemia under the control condition, with or without the electromechanical uncoupler blebbistatin. We found that pretreatment with 100 (n = 4) and 50 (n = 6) nM FCCP, with or without blebbistatin, leads to VF during ischemia in all hearts, whereas pretreatment with 30 nM of FCCP led to three out of eight hearts going into VF during ischemia. We demonstrated that 30 nM of FCCP significantly increased interventricular (but not intraventricular) action potential duration and conduction velocity heterogeneity in the heart during ischemia, thus providing the substrate for VF. We showed that wavebreaks during VF occurred between the right and left ventricular junction. We also demonstrated that no VF occurred in the heart pretreated with 10 $\mu$M glibenclamide, which is known to abolish interventricular heterogeneity. Our results indicate that low concentrations of FCCP, although cardioprotective at the single cell level, are arrhythmogenic at the whole heart level. This is due to the fact that FCCP induces different electrophysiological changes to the right and left ventricle, thus increasing interventricular heterogeneity and providing the substrate for VF.},

abstract = {AIMS: Apelin, an endogenous cytokine, has a number of biological effects on the cardiovascular system, including a cardioprotective effect and calcium modulation. Because the intracellular calcium abnormality is considered to play an important role in cardiac dysfunction induced by ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R), the aim of this study was to examine the effects of apelin-13 on I/R-induced changes in cardiac performance and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated rat hearts were subjected to global ischaemia followed by reperfusion in the absence or presence of apelin-13 and inhibitors of some survival kinases. We found that depressed cardiac performance induced by I/R was attenuated by apelin-13. Furthermore, apelin-13 depressed oxidative stress during I/R. SR function depressed during I/R was partly reversed by apelin-13. SR oxidative modification levels were increased in I/R and reversed by apelin. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase C abolished the effects of apelin. Apelin-13 maintained the Ca(2+) transient against I/R in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: Apelin protects SR function and cardiac performance during I/R by attenuating oxidation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and RyR.},

abstract = {Membrane ion channels and transporters are key determinants of cardiac electrical function. Their expression is affected by cardiac region, hemodynamic properties, heart-rate changes, neurohormones and cardiac disease. One of the important determinants of ion-channel function is the level of ion-channel subunit mRNA expression, which governs the production of ion-channel proteins that traffic to the cell-membrane to form functional ion-channels. Ion-channel mRNA-expression profiling can be performed with cDNA microarrays or high-throughput reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Expression profiling has been applied to evaluate the dependence of ion-channel expression on cardiac region, revealing the molecular basis of regionally-controlled electrical properties as well as the molecular determinants of specialized electrical functions like pacemaking activity. Ion-channel remodeling occurs with cardiac diseases like heart failure, congenital repolarization abnormalities, and atrial fibrillation, and expression profiling has provided insights into the mechanisms by which these conditions affect cardiac electrical stability. Expression profiling has also shown how hormonal changes, antiarrhythmic drugs, cardiac development and altered heart rate affect ion-channel expression patterns to modify cardiac electrical function and sometimes to produce cardiac rhythm disturbances. This article reviews the information obtained to date with the application of cardiac ion-channel expression profiling. With increasing availability and efficiency of high-throughput PCR methods for ion-channel subunit mRNA-expression characterization, it is likely that the application of ion-channel expression profiling will increase and that it will provide important new insights into the determinants of cardiac electrical function in both physiological and pathological situations.},

Nevertheless, bringing theoretical results to an agreement with experimental observations involves acknowledging a great deal of uncertainty intrinsic to our theoretical representation of a real system. Proper handling of such uncertainties is key to the successful usage of models to predict experimental or field observations. This problem has been addressed over the years by many tools for model calibration and parameter estimation. In this article we present a general framework for uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation that is designed to handle uncertainties associated with the modeling of dynamic biological systems while remaining agnostic as to the type of model used.

abstract = {Intracellular calcium transient alternans (CTA) has a recognized role in arrhythmogenesis, but its origin is not yet fully understood. Recent models of CTA are based on a steep relationship between calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and its calcium load before release. This mechanism alone, however, does not explain recent observations of CTA without diastolic SR calcium content alternations. In addition, nanoscopic imaging of calcium dynamics has revealed that the elementary calcium release units of the SR can become refractory independently of their local calcium content. Here we show using a new physiologically detailed mathematical model of calcium cycling that luminal gating of the calcium release channels (RyRs) mediated by the luminal buffer calsequestrin (CSQN) can cause CTA independently of the steepness of the release-load relationship. In this complementary mechanism, CTA is caused by a beat-to-beat alternation in the number of refractory RyR channels and can occur with or without diastolic SR calcium content alternans depending on pacing conditions and uptake dynamics. The model has unique features, in that it treats a realistic number of spatially distributed and diffusively coupled dyads, each one with a realistic number of RyR channels, and that luminal CSQN buffering and gating is incorporated based on experimental data that characterizes the effect of the conformational state of CSQN on its buffering properties. In addition to reproducing observed features of CTA, this multiscale model is able to describe recent experiments in which CSQN expression levels were genetically altered as well as to reproduce nanoscopic measurements of spark restitution properties. The ability to link microscopic properties of the calcium release units to whole cell behavior makes this model a powerful tool to investigate the arrhythmogenic role of abnormal calcium handling in many pathological settings.},

abstract = {Optical mapping studies have suggested that intracellular Ca2+ and T-wave alternans are linked through underlying alternations in Ca2+ cycling-inducing oscillations in action potential duration through Ca2+-sensitive conductances. However, these studies cannot measure single-cell behavior; therefore, the Ca2+ cycling heterogeneities within microscopic ventricular regions are unknown. The goal of this study was to measure cellular activity in intact myocardium during rapid pacing and arrhythmias. We used single-photon laser-scanning confocal microscopy to measure Ca2+ signaling in individual myocytes of intact rat myocardium during rapid pacing and during pacing-induced ventricular arrhythmias. At low rates, all myocytes demonstrate Ca2+ alternans that is synchronized but whose magnitude varies depending on recovery kinetics of Ca2+ cycling for each individual myocyte. As rate increases, some cells reverse alternans phase, giving a dyssynchronous activation pattern, even in adjoining myocytes. Increased pacing rate also induces subcellular alternans where Ca2+ alternates out of phase with different regions within the same cell. These forms of heterogeneous Ca2+ signaling also occurred during pacing-induced ventricular tachycardia. Our results demonstrate highly nonuniform Ca2+ signaling among and within individual myocytes in intact heart during rapid pacing and arrhythmias. Thus, certain pathophysiological conditions that alter Ca2+ cycling kinetics, such as heart failure, might promote ventricular arrhythmias by exaggerating these cellular heterogeneities in Ca2+ signaling.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the properties of ion channels generates spatial dispersion of ventricular repolarization, which is modulated by gap junctional coupling. However, it is possible to simulate conditions in which local differences in excitation properties are electrophysiologically silent and only play a role in pathological states. We use a numerical procedure on the Luo–Rudy phase 1 model of the ventricular action potential (AP1) in order to find a modified set of model parameters which generates an action potential profile (AP2) almost identical to AP1. We show that, although the two waveforms elicited from resting conditions as a single AP are very similar and belong to membranes sharing similar passive electrical properties, the modified membrane generating AP2 is a weaker current source than the one generating AP1, has different sensitivity to up/down-regulation of ion channels and to extracellular potassium, and a different electrical restitution profile. We study electrotonic interaction of AP1- and AP2 - type membranes in cell pairs and in cable conduction, and find differences in source–sink properties which are masked in physiological conditions and become manifest during intercellular uncoupling or partial block of ion channels, leading to unidirectional block and spatial repolarization gradients. We provide contour plot representations that summarize differences and similarities. The present report characterizes an inverse problem in cardiac cells, and strengthen the recently emergent notion that a comprehensive characterization and validation of cell models and their components are necessary in order to correctly understand simulation results at higher levels of complexity.},

abstract = {We construct a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ regulation in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.},

Here we describe a single-channel-based Markovian modelling approach that bridges this gap. We achieve this by determining the cellular arrhythmogenic consequences of a mutation in the cardiac sodium channel that can lead to a clinical arrhythmogenic disorder (the long-QT syndrome) and sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {From our everyday life, we know that our hearts beat with a rhythm which is not perfectly periodic. Even an isolated spontaneously beating cardiac cell, devoid of neural, hormonal, and intracardiac regulatory input, does not beat perfectly regularly. l investigate the hypothesis that the beat-to-beat fluctuations in transmembrane potential of spontaneously beating cardiac cells are due to stochastic gating of the ionic channels in the cell membrane. Recordings of transmembrane potential from small clusters of spontaneously beating 7-day-old embryonic chick ventricular cells were analyzed to characterize the voltage waveform and the regularity of beating. l constructed a deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type ionic model which reproduces spontaneous activity in our ex- perimental recordings, as well as the experimental results of applying various ion channel blockers (D-600, almokalant, and BaH). The model consists of six currents: a calcium current (Ica), three potassium currents (IKs, IKn IKd, a background cur- rent (h), and a seal-Ieak current (Iseal). The deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type model was then reformulated into a stochastic single-channel model. The single-channel model reproduces the irregularity of beating seen experimentally: e.g. the coefficient of variation of interbeat interval was 4.4\% vs. 3.9\% in the clusters. In the model, I Ks is the current giving the major contributions to fluctuations in interbeat interval. Phase resetting of the spontaneous activity of cardiac pacemaker cells by a brief stimulus pulse was simulated in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and single-channel models of slow-upstroke (central) and fast-upstroke (peripheral) rabbit sinoatrial node cells. In the Hodgkin-Huxley-type models the phase-resetting response is con- tinuous, but can be extremely delicate in the fast-upstroke model, in that a tiny difference in the stimulus timing can change the stimulus response from a delayed action potential to an advanced one. Therefore, the noise in the fast-upstroke single- channel model can cause a stimulus with fixed amplitude and fixed timing to have widely different effects: sometimes it will induce an action potential but in other cases it will delay an action potential, as seen previously in experiments on cardiac preparations.},

abstract = {QT dispersion has been adopted as a new index for the noninvasive assessment of the inhomogeneity of repolarization and has been evaluated in several clinical studies as an index of arrhythmia propensity. In most of these studies, indices of dispersion of repolarization were rate corrected by the Bazett formula calculating QT dispersion as QT cmax-QT cmin or JT dispersion as JT cmax-JT cmin, implying that dispersion of repolarization also changes with heart rate. This study aimed to determine in the electrically paced isolated heart whether dispersion of ventricular repolarization is rate dependent. Multiple (5-7) monophasic action potentials (MAPs) were recorded simultaneously from the epicardium and endocardium of both ventricles in 18 isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Hearts were paced from a right ventricular site at basic cycle lengths (CL) between 1,200 and 300 ms in 100-ms decrements. Action potential duration was measured at 90\% repolarization (APD90), and recovery time (RT) was defined as the sum of APD90 and activation time in each of the simultaneous MAP recordings. The dispersion of APD90 and RT, respectively, were calculated as the maximal difference among all recordings. APD90 and RT shortened continuously throughout the range of paced steady-state CLs from 1,200 to 300 ms. APD90 was 197.6 +/- 6.1 ms at a CL of 1,200 ms and decreased to 148.5 +/- 2.5 ms at a CL of 300 ms (P < 0.0001). RT was 228.2 +/- 6.2 ms at a CL of 1,000 ms and decreased to 175.9 +/- 2.9 at a CL of 300 ms (P < 0.0001). In contrast, dispersion of APD90 and RT did not change significantly. Dispersion of APD90 was 24.8 +/- 2.3 ms at a CL of 1,200 ms, 26.1 +/- 1.9 msec at a CL of 1,000 ms, and 21.6 +/- 2.1 at a CL of 300 ms (NS). Dispersion of RT was 29.7 +/- 3.4 ms at a CL of 1,200 ms, 29.0 +/- 3.0 ms at a CL of 1,000 ms, and 32.7 +/- 3.2 ms at a CL of 300 ms (NS). In contrast to the duration of the QT interval, dispersion of ventricular repolarization does not change significantly with pacing induced changes in CL. Assuming that the rate-dependent behavior of action potential duration is similar between the rabbit and human heart, a rate correction of parameters of dispersion of repolarization is probably unnecessary.},

abstract = {Rapid progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which calcium ions mediate certain cardiac arrhythmias. Principal advances include imaging of cytosolic calcium in isolated cells and in intact tissues, use of fluorescent indicators and monophasic action potentials to record membrane potentials in isolated tissue, and sequencing of the genes that encode critical ion channel proteins. In this review, five types of arrhythmias are discussed where calcium ion currents, or currents controlled by calcium, appear to be responsible for arrythmogenesis. These include: (1) the delayed afterpotential that occurs in conditions of intracellular calcium overload such as digitalis toxicity; (2) the early afterdepolarization that occurs when action potential duration is prolonged; (3) the slowly conducted calcium-dependent action potential (the slow response) in the SA and AV nodes; (4) the phenomenon of calcium transient alternans during ischemia, which is related to action potential duration alternans and t-wave alternans; (5) catecholamine-induced cardiac arrhythmias in families with mutations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channel. For each type of arrhythmia, the clinical implications of emerging knowledge are discussed. An especially important issue is whether ventricular fibrillation during acute coronary artery occlusion is due to calcium transient alternans. Ventricular fibrillation due to acute ischemia is an important subset of the 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths that occur annually in the U.S. Certain drugs, including beta blockers, fish oils, verapamil, and diltiazem, seem to specifically prevent ventricular fibrillation in this setting, and in most cases an effect of the drug on cytosolic calicum appears to be involved.},

abstract = {Rationale: Compartmentation of ion channels on the cardiomyocyte surface is important for electrical propagation and electromechanical coupling. The specialized T-tubule and costameric structures facilitate spatial coupling of various ion channels and receptors. Existing methods like immunofluorescence and patch-clamp techniques are limited in their ability to localize functional ion channels. As such, a correlation between channel protein location and channel function remains incomplete. Objective: To validate a method that permits to routinely image the topography of a live cardiomyocyte, and then study clustering of functional ion channels from a specific microdomain. Methods and Results: We used scanning ion conductance microscopy and conventional cell-attached patch-clamp with a software modification that allows controlled increase of pipette tip diameter. The sharp nanopipette used for topography scan was modified into a larger patch pipette which can be positioned with nanoscale precision to a specific site of interest (crest, groove or T-tubules of cardiomyocytes), and sealed to the membrane for cell-attached recording of ion channels. Using this method, we significantly increased the probability of detecting activity of L-type calcium channels in the T-tubules of ventricular cardiomyocytes. We also demonstrated that active sodium channels do not distribute homogenously on the sarcolemma but rather, they segregate into clusters of various densities -most crowded in the crest region- that are surrounded by areas virtually free of functional sodium channels. Conclusions: Our new method substantially increases the throughput of recording location-specific functional ion channels on the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma, thus allowing characterization of ion channels in relation to the microdomain in which they reside.},

abstract = {Scaling of action potential (AP) duration (APD) in mammals of different size is a rather complex phenomenon, dominated by a regulatory type mechanism of ion channels expression. By means of simulations performed on six published mathematical models of cardiac ventricular APs of different mammals, it is shown that AP repolarization is autoregenerative in its later phase (ARRP) and that the duration of such phase scales linearly with APD. For each AP, a 3-D instantaneous time-voltage-current surface is constructed, which has been recently described in a more simplified model. This representation allows us to measure ARRP and to study the contribution to it for different ion currents. It has been found that the existence of an ARRP is not intrinsic to cardiac models formulation; one out of the six models does not show this phase. A linear correlation between ARRP duration and APD in the remaining models is also found. It is shown that ARRP neither simply depend on AP shape nor on APD. Though I(K1) current seems to be the main responsible for determining and modulating this phase, the mechanism by which ARRP scales linearly with APD remains unclear and raises further questions on the scaling strategies of cardiac repolarization in mammals.},

abstract = {1. The delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) of single pace-maker cells from the sino-atrial node and the atrioventricular node of the rabbit heart was investigated using the whole-cell and cell-attached configurations of the patch-clamp technique. 2. The activation kinetics of the macroscopic IK were not altered by varying the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) between 5.4 and 150 mM. The amplitude of the tail current of IK, however, was about 10-fold larger at a [K+]o of 150 mM than that at a [K+]o of 5.4 mM. 3. By using a high-[K+]o solution, inward single-channel currents were observed on repolarization from potentials positive to -40 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) relation was linear over the negative potential range and the reversal potential estimated by extrapolating the I-V curve was shifted by about 60 mV for a 10-fold increase in [K+]o, indicating that the channel was highly selective for K+. 4. The single-channel conductance was 11.1 pS at a [K+]o of 150 mM and varied in proportion to the square root of [K+]o. The total number of channels was estimated as approximately 1000 per cell (0.7/micron 2). On repolarization, the averaged single-channel current disappeared with a time constant similar to that of the macroscopic tail current of IK. 5. At potentials between -50 and -100 mV, the open and closed times of the single channel fitted well with single-exponential and biexponential distributions, respectively. As the membrane was progressively depolarized, the open time was shortened while the closed time was prolonged, suggesting a decrease of open probability. These changes were in the opposite direction to those expected from the delayed rectifier K+ current which progressively increases in magnitude at more positive potentials. 6. At the beginning of the macroscopic tail current, a transient increase of the inward current was found to precede the time-dependent decrease. This rapid initial change can be attributed to a quick removal of inactivation of IK which had occurred during the depolarizing pulse. This inactivation gate of the channel has very fast kinetics and could be responsible for the inward-going rectification observed in the 'fully activated' IK.},

abstract = {The electrical activity of a neuron is strongly dependent on the ionic channels present in its membrane. Modifying the maximal conductances from these channels can have a dramatic impact on neuron behavior. But the effect of such modifications can also be cancelled out by compensatory mechanisms among different channels. We used an evolution strategy with a fitness function based on phase-plane analysis to obtain 20 very different computational models of the cerebellar Purkinje cell. All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections, including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape. Unraveling the landscape is an important step towards the understanding of functional homeostasis of neurons.},

@article{Luo1994,
abstract = {The action potential model presented in our accompanying article in this journal is used to investigate phenomena that involve dynamic changes of [Ca2+]i, as described below. Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) are induced by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which, in turn, activates both the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger (INaCa) and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated current (Ins(Ca)). The relative contributions of INaCa and of Ins(Ca) to the generation of DADs are different under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) can be categorized into two types: (1) plateau EADs, resulting from a secondary activation of the L-type Ca2+ current during the plateau of an action potential, and (2) phase-3 EADs, resulting from activation of INaCa and Ins(Ca) by increased [Ca2+]i due to spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR during the late repolarization phase. Spontaneous rhythmic activity and triggered activity are caused by spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR under conditions of Ca2+ overload. Postextrasystolic potentiation reflects the time delay associated with translocation of Ca2+ from network SR to junctional SR. The cell is paced at high frequencies to investigate the long-term effects on the intracellular ionic concentrations.},

abstract = {Cardiac repolarization abnormalities can be caused by a wide range of cardiac and non-cardiac compounds and may lead to the development of life-threatening Torsades de Pointes (TdP) ventricular arrhythmias. Drug-induced torsades de pointes is associated with unexpected and unexplained sudden cardiac deaths resulting in the withdrawal of several compounds in the past. To better understand the mechanism of such unexpected sudden cardiac deaths, the concept of repolarization reserve has recently emerged. According to this concept, pharmacological, congenital or acquired impairment of one type of transmembrane ion channel does not necessarily result in excessive repolarization changes because other repolarizing currents can take over and compensate. In this review, the major factors contributing to repolarization reserve are discussed in the context of their clinical significance in physiological and pathophysiological conditions including drug administration, genetic defects, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, gender, renal failure, hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism and athletes' sudden deaths. In addition, pharmacological support of repolarization reserve as a possible therapeutic option is discussed. Some methods for the quantitative estimation of repolarization reserve are also recommended. It is concluded that repolarization reserve should be considered by safety pharmacologists to better understand, predict and prevent previously unexplained drug-induced sudden cardiac deaths.},

abstract = {The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is higher in failing hearts than in control hearts, especially during acute ischemia. Electrophysiological and extracellular ionic changes during acute ischemia in normal and failing rabbit myocardium were assessed. Heart failure was induced in rabbits by combined volume and pressure overload. In perfused papillary muscles, the onset of electrical uncoupling and changes in action potential duration and conduction velocity during acute ischemia were determined. In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts the changes in extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and pH during acute global ischemia were studied. In perfused papillary muscles, during the first 10 min of ischemia, action potential duration at 80\% of repolarization decreased more in preparations from failing than from control hearts (from 174 to 104 ms and from 156 to 119 ms respectively (P < 0.001)). Conduction velocity was significantly lower in failing hearts during ischemia (P < 0.005). The onset of electrical uncoupling was similar in failing and control hearts (mean +/- S.E.M., 17 +/- 1 and 15 +/- 1 min respectively, n.s.). Langendorff-perfused hearts [K+]o, after 10 min of ischemia, was 11.0 +/- 0.4 mM in failing and 9.5 +/- 0.3 mM in control hearts (P < 0.01), while the change in pH was the same. After pretreatment with glibenclamide, an ATP sensitive K+ channel blocker, [K+]o reached lower values after 10 min of ischemia in both failing (8.8 +/- 0.5 mM) and control hearts (7.2 +/- 0.4 mM). During ischemia, action potential duration shortening is more pronounced and conduction velocity is lower in failing myocardium than in control myocardium. [K+]o reaches higher values during acute ischemia in failing compared with normal myocardium. These changes are not caused by an earlier activation of IK.ATP. Increased spatial dispersion in electrophysiological parameters and [K+]o over the ischemic border in failing hearts may explain the higher propensity for reentrant arrhythmias during acute regional ischemia in failing hearts.},

I then discuss a number of issues raised by this observation, such as which parameter variations arise from compensatory mechanisms and which reflect insensitivity to those particular parameters. I ask whether networks with different sets of underlying parameters can nonetheless respond reliably to neuromodulation and other global perturbations. At the computational level, I describe a paradigm shift in which it is becoming increasingly common to develop families of models that reflect the variance in the biological data that the models are intended to illuminate rather than single, highly tuned models. On the experimental side, I discuss the inherent limitations of overreliance on mean data and suggest that it is important to look for compensations and correlations among as many system parameters as possible, and between each system parameter and circuit performance. This second paradigm shift will require moving away from measurements of each system component in isolation but should reveal important previously undescribed principles in the organization of complex systems such as brains.},

abstract = {Gap junctions play a pivotal role for the velocity and the safety of impulse propagation in cardiac tissue. Under physiologic conditions, the specific subcellular distribution of gap junctions together with the tight packaging of the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes underlies anisotropic conduction, which is continuous at the macroscopic scale. However, when breaking down the three-dimensional network of cells into linear single cell chains, gap junctions can be shown to limit axial current flow and to induce 'saltatory' conduction at unchanged overall conduction velocities. In two- and three-dimensional tissue, these discontinuities disappear due to lateral averaging of depolarizing current flow at the activation wavefront. During gap junctional uncoupling, discontinuities reappear and are accompanied by slowed and meandering conduction. Critical gap junctional uncoupling reduces conduction velocities to a much larger extent than does a reduction of excitability, which suggests that the safety for conduction is higher at any given conduction velocity for gap junctional uncoupling. In uniformly structured tissue, gap junctional uncoupling is accompanied by a parallel decrease in conduction velocity. However, this is not necessarily the case for non-uniform structures like tissue expansion where partial uncoupling paradoxically increases conduction velocity and has the capacity to remove unidirectional conduction blocks. Whereas the impact of gap junctions on impulse conduction is generally assessed from the point of view of cell coupling among cardiomyocytes, it is possible that other cell types within the myocardium might be coupled to cardiomyocytes as well. In this context, it has been shown that fibroblasts establish successful conduction between sheets of cardiomyocytes over distances as long as 300 microm. This might not only explain electrical synchronization of heart transplants but might be of importance for cardiac diseases involving fibrosis. Finally, the intriguing fact that sodium channels are clustered at the intercalated disc recently rekindled the provocative question of whether gap junctions alone are responsible for impulse propagation or whether electric field mechanisms might account for conduction as well. Whereas computer simulations show the feasibility of conduction in the absence of gap junctional coupling, a definite answer to this question must await further investigations into the biophysical properties of the intercalated disc.},

abstract = {1. The contribution of the concentrating effect due to shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) to cellular K+ efflux on extracellular potassium ([K+]o) accumulation in response to ischaemia was investigated in an isolated, blood-perfused rabbit papillary muscle preparation with a confined extracellular space. 2. The ECS was quantified using either of two extracellular markers, choline or tetramethyl ammonium (TMA), each with specific ion-selective electrodes, as well as by measurement of extracellular resistance (ro). [K+]o and [Na+]o were also measured simultaneously using K(+)- and Na(+)-selective electrodes. 3. During ischaemia, [K+]o increased 3-fold from 4.2 +/- 0.1 to 12.6 +/- 1.0 mM at 10 min (n = 10) analogous to changes in the ischaemic heart in vivo. The ECS decreased to 83.9 +/- 3.2\% of control measured using 1 mM choline extracellularly (n = 9, P < 0.01) or to 85.7 +/- 0.7\% of control using 1 mM TMA (n = 6, P < 0.01). Nearly identical decreases in ro (84.1 +/- 2.4\%, n = 15, P < 0.01) occurred simultaneously. 4. The small decrease in the ECS contributed only 0.8-0.9 mM to the total increase in [K+]o of 8.4 mM and had a minor effect on transmembrane K+ flux. No significant differences between the relative changes in [choline] and [Na+]o were observed. This excluded a major transmembrane Na+ movement during early ischaemia. 5. Bumetanide (10 mM), an inhibitor of K(+)-Cl- cotransport, a process which is involved in cell volume regulation consequent to osmotic cell swelling, significantly attenuated the increase in [K+]o after 6 min of ischaemia (8.3 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 5 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.4 mM in the control group, n = 6, P < 0.05), whereas N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM), a stimulator of this cotransporter, augmented [K+]o accumulation (12.0 +/- 0.6 mM at 6 min, P < 0.05). 6. We conclude that during early myocardial ischaemia, a major component of [K+]o accumulation is not caused by diminution of ECS per se, but rather by increased net K+ efflux due in part to K(+)-Cl cotransport secondary to myocyte volume regulation.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that remodelling of action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) dynamics in the peri-infarct zone contributes to ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the postmyocardial infarction setting. To test this hypothesis, we performed simultaneous optical mapping of Ca(i) and membrane potential (V(m)) in the left ventricle in 15 rabbit hearts with myocardial infarction for 1 week. Ventricular premature beats frequently originated from the peri-infarct zone, and 37\% showed elevation of Ca(i) prior to V(m) depolarization, suggesting reverse excitation-contraction coupling as their aetiology. During electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, the highest dominant frequency was in the peri-infarct zone in 61 of 70 episodes. The site of highest dominant frequency had steeper action potential duration restitution and was more susceptible to pacing-induced Ca(i) alternans than sites remote from infarct. Wavebreaks during ventricular fibrillation tended to occur at sites of persistently elevated Ca(i). Infusion of propranolol flattened action potential duration restitution, reduced wavebreaks and converted ventricular fibrillation to ventricular tachycardia. We conclude that in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction, the peri-infarct zone exhibits regions with steep action potential duration restitution slope and unstable Ca(i) dynamics. These changes may promote ventricular extrasystoles and increase the incidence of wavebreaks during ventricular fibrillation. Whereas increased tissue heterogeneity after subacute myocardial infarction creates a highly arrhythmogenic substrate, dynamic action potential and Ca(i) cycling remodelling also contribute to the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation in this setting.},

@article{Tester2005,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum and prevalence of cardiac channel mutations among a large cohort of consecutive, unrelated patients referred for long QT syndrome (LQTS) genetic testing. BACKGROUND: Congenital LQTS is a primary cardiac channelopathy. More than 300 mutations have been identified in five genes encoding key ion channel subunits. Until the recent release of the commercial clinical genetic test, LQTS genetic testing had been performed in research laboratories during the past decade. METHODS: A cardiac channel gene screen for LQTS-causing mutations in KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), SCN5A (LQT3), KCNE1 (LQT5), and KCNE2 (LQT6) was performed for 541 consecutive, unrelated patients (358 females, average age at diagnosis 24 +/- 16 years, average QTc 482 +/- 57 ms) referred to Mayo Clinic's Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory for LQTS genetic testing between August 1997 and July 2004. A comprehensive open reading frame and splice site analysis of the 60 protein-encoding exons was conducted using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, 211 putative pathogenic mutations in KCNQ1 (88), KCNH2 (89), SCN5A (32), KCNE1 (1), and KCNE2 (1) were found in 272 unrelated patients (50\%). Among the genotype positive patients (N = 272), 243 had single pathogenic mutations (LQT1: n = 120 patients; LQT2: n = 93; LQT3: n = 26; LQT5: n = 3; LQT6: n = 1), and 29 patients (10\% of genotype-positive patients and 5\% overall) had two LQTS-causing mutations. The majority of mutations were missense mutations (154/210 [73\%]), singletons (identified in only a single unrelated patient: 165/210 [79\%]), and novel (125/211 [59\%]). None of the mutations identified were seen in more than 1,500 reference alleles. Those patients harboring multiple mutations were younger at diagnosis (15 +/- 11 years vs 24 +/- 16 years, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive cardiac channel gene screen of the largest cohort of consecutive, unrelated patients referred for LQTS genetic testing, half of the patients had an identifiable mutation. The majority of mutations continue to represent novel singletons that expand the published compendium of LQTS-causing mutations by 35\%. These observations should facilitate diagnostic interpretation of the clinical genetic test for LQTS.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle exhibits mechanosensitivity independent of neural input, suggesting that mechanosensitive pathways reside within smooth muscle cells. The native L-type calcium current recorded from human intestinal smooth muscle is modulated by stretch. To define mechanosensitive mechanisms involved in the regulation of smooth muscle calcium entry, we cloned the alpha(1C) L-type calcium channel subunit (Ca(V)1.2) from human intestinal smooth muscle and expressed the channel in a heterologous system. This channel subunit retained mechanosensitivity when expressed alone or coexpressed with a beta(2) calcium channel subunit in HEK-293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells. The heterologously expressed human cardiac alpha(1C) splice form also demonstrated mechanosensitivity. Inhibition of kinase signaling did not affect mechanosensitivity of the native channel. Truncation of the alpha(1C) COOH terminus, which contains an inhibitory domain and a proline-rich domain thought to mediate mechanosensitive signaling from integrins, did not disrupt mechanosensitivity of the expressed channel. These data demonstrate mechanical regulation of calcium entry through molecularly identified L-type calcium channels in mammalian cells and suggest that the mechanosensitivity resides within the pore forming alpha(1C)-subunit.},

abstract = {To investigate the mechanisms regulating excitation-metabolic coupling in rabbit epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial ventricular myocytes we extended the LabHEART model (Puglisi JL and Bers DM. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 281: C2049-C2060, 2001). We incorporated equations for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) buffering by ATP and ADP, equations for nucleotide regulation of ATP-sensitive K(+) channel and L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, and sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPases, and equations describing the basic pathways (creatine and adenylate kinase reactions) known to communicate the flux changes generated by intracellular ATPases. Under normal conditions and during 20 min of ischemia, the three regions were characterized by different I(Na), I(to), I(Kr), I(Ks), and I(Kp) channel properties. The results indicate that the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel is activated by the smallest reduction in ATP in epicardial cells and largest in endocardial cells when cytosolic ADP, AMP, PCr, Cr, P(i), total Mg(2+), Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and pH diastolic levels are normal. The model predicts that only K(ATP) ionophore (Kir6.2 subunit) and not the regulatory subunit (SUR2A) might differ from endocardium to epicardium. The analysis suggests that during ischemia, the inhomogeneous accumulation of the metabolites in the tissue sublayers may alter in a very irregular manner the K(ATP) channel opening through metabolic interactions with the endogenous PI cascade (PIP(2), PIP) that in turn may cause differential action potential shortening among the ventricular myocyte subtypes. The model predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental data measured under normal and ischemic conditions in rabbit ventricular myocytes.},

abstract = {Myocardial ischemia is a condition in which the coronary blood flow to the heart is reduced, which results in deficient oxygen and nutrients supply to the heart. Reperfusion to an ischemic myocardium often results in lethal myocardial injury. The brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion given before prolonged ischemia and reperfusion denote pre-conditioning. On the other hand, brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion given after prolonged ischemia and at the onset of reperfusion denotes postconditioning. Pre- and postconditioning are anti-jeopardized phenomenons in which both forms have been shown to protect the myocardium from lethal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, numerous experimental studies reveal that the cardioprotective effects of these phenomenons have been suppressed in presence of some pathological factors such as hyperglycemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, etc. In this review, we have critically discussed the mechanisms involved in the cardioprotective effects of pre- and postconditioning to limit ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. Moreover, the clinical relevance and factors affecting the cardioprotective potentials of pre- and postconditioning have been delineated.},

abstract = {It is well known that phosphorylation of the membrane protein phospholamban by cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase results in the activation of the Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); such enzyme activation is thought to be due to the disruption of an inhibitory interaction of non-phosphorylated phospholamban with the ATPase. We describe here a novel mechanism for the regulation of the ATPase through direct phosphorylation of this enzyme by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) associated with the SR membrane. It is shown that incubation of cardiac SR in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin results in the phosphorylation of the ATPase in addition to the previously recognized substrates of CaM kinase, viz. phospholamban and Ca2+ channel. The phosphorylated amino acid in the ATPase has been identified as serine. Phosphorylation of the membrane-bound ATPase is stimulated by exogenous CaM kinase. Furthermore, ATPase purified from cardiac SR is phosphorylated by exogenous CaM kinase and the phosphorylated enzyme displays 2-fold increase in catalytic activity without any appreciable change in its Ca2+ sensitivity. Thus, direct phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase by CaM kinase can stimulate its enzymatic activity and, therefore, Ca2+ transport function.},

However, the precise sequence of events linking RyR channel mutations to a whole heart arrhythmia is not completely understood. In this paper, we apply a detailed, mathematical model of subcellular calcium (Ca) release, coupled to membrane voltage, to study how defective RyR channels can induce arrhythmogenic-triggered activity. In particular, we show that subcellular Ca activity, such as spontaneous Ca sparks and Ca waves, is highly sensitive to coupled gating between RyR channels in clusters. We show that small changes in coupled gating can induce aberrant Ca release activity, which, under Ca overload conditions, can induce delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). We systematically investigate the properties of subcellular Ca during DAD induction and show that the voltage time course during a DAD is dependent on the timing and number of spontaneous Ca sparks that transition to Ca waves. These results provide a detailed mechanism for the role of coupled gating in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias.},

Disruption of this equilibrium can result in arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death. Congenital defects result in an unpredictable expression of phenotypes with variable penetrance, even within single families. Additionally, phenotypically opposite and overlapping cardiac arrhythmogenic syndromes can stem from one mutation. A number of these defects have been characterized experimentally with the aim of understanding mechanisms of mutation-induced arrhythmia. Improving understanding of abnormalities may provide a basis for the development of therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {The role of the ATP-sensitive K+ current (IK-ATP) and its contribution to electrophysiological changes that occur during metabolic impairment in cardiac ventricular myocytes is still being discussed. The aim of this work was to quantitatively study this issue by using computer modeling. A model of IK-ATP is formulated and incorporated into the Luo-Rudy ionic model of the ventricular action potential. Action potentials under different degrees of activation of IK-ATP are simulated. Our results show that in normal ionic concentrations, only ≈0.6\% of the KATP channels, when open, should account for a 50\% reduction in action potential duration. However, increased levels of intracellular Mg2+ counteract this shortening. Under conditions of high [K+]o, such as those found in early ischemia, the activation of only ≈0.4\% of the KATP channels could account for a 50\% reduction in action potential duration. Thus, our results suggest that opening of IK-ATP channels should play a significant role in action potential shortening during hypoxic/ischemic episodes, with the fraction of open channels involved being very low (<1\%). However, the results of the model suggest that activation of IK-ATP alone does not quantitatively account for the observed K+ efflux in metabolically impaired cardiac myocytes. Mechanisms other than KATP channel activation should be responsible for a significant part of the K+ efflux measured in hypoxic/ischemic situations.},

abstract = {Na+ current (INa) through wild-type human heart Na+ channels (hH1) is important for normal cardiac excitability and conduction, and it participates in the control of repolarization and refractoriness. INa kinetics depend strongly on temperature, but INa for hH1 has been studied previously only at room temperature. We characterized early INa (the peak and initial decay) and late INa of the wild-type hH1 channel and a mutant channel (DeltaKPQ) associated with congenital long Q-T syndrome. Channels were stably transfected in HEK-293 cells and studied at 23 and 33 degreesC using whole cell patch clamp. Activation and inactivation kinetics for early INa were twofold faster at higher temperature for both channels and shifted activation and steady-state inactivation in the positive direction, especially for DeltaKPQ. For early INa (<24 ms), DeltaKPQ decayed faster than the wild type for voltages negative to -20 mV but slower for more positive voltages, suggesting a reduced voltage dependence of fast inactivation. Late INa at 240 ms was significantly greater for DeltaKPQ than for the wild type at both temperatures. The majority of late INa for DeltaKPQ was not persistent; rather, it decayed slowly, and this late component exhibited slower recovery from inactivation compared with peak INa. Additional kinetic changes for early and peak INa for DeltaKPQ compared with the wild type at both temperatures were 1) reduced voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation with no difference in midpoint, 2) positive shift for activation kinetics, and 3) more rapid recovery from inactivation. This study represents the first description of human Na+ channel kinetics near physiological temperature and also demonstrates complex gating changes in the DeltaKPQ that are present at 33 degreesC and that may underlie the electrophysiological and clinical phenotype of congenital long Q-T Na+ channel syndromes.},

abstract = {Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration during myocardial ischemia were measured by 19F NMR in 5FBAPTA-loaded perfused rat hearts. The hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 microM of the acetoxymethyl ester of 5FBAPTA, which was hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases to achieve cytosolic concentrations of 5FBAPTA of 0.12 to 0.65 mM. Cytosolic free calcium concentrations were calculated as the product of the ratio of peak areas for bound and free 5FBAPTA in the NMR spectra and the dissociation constant (708 nM). The basal cytosolic calcium concentration, measured in potassium or magnesium arrested hearts, was 252 nM, and the time-average calcium concentration in beating hearts was 630 nM. Following the onset of total ischemia, there was no immediate substantial change in cytosolic calcium despite a rapid decline in creatine phosphate and ATP and a marked increase in inorganic phosphate as monitored by 31P NMR, but by 10 minutes, there was a substantial increase in free calcium concentration. The ratio of peak areas of bound and free 5FBAPTA returned to the preischemic value during reperfusion, and there was no detectable loss of 5FBAPTA from the heart. Creatine phosphate was also restored to its preischemic level during reperfusion. These results indicate that cytosolic free calcium increases during ischemia and is not immediately associated with lethal injury. This increase in cytosolic calcium may activate degradative enzymes that eventually could compromise myocyte viability.},

abstract = {In excitable cells, the generation of an action potential (AP) is associated with transient changes of the intra- and extracellular concentrations of small ions such as Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-). If these changes cannot be fully reversed between successive APs cumulative changes of trans-membrane ion gradients will occur, impinging on the cell volume and the duration, amplitude and frequency of APs. Previous computational studies focused on effects associated with excitation-induced changes of potassium and sodium. Here we present a model based study on the influence of chloride on the fidelity of AP firing and cellular volume regulation during excitation. Our simulations show that depending on the magnitude of the basal chloride permeability two complementary types of responsiveness and volume variability exist: (i) At high chloride permeability (typical for muscle cells), large excitatory stimuli are required to elicit APs; repetitive stimuli of equal strength result in almost identical spike train patterns (Markovian behavior), however, long excitation may lead to after discharges due to an outward directed current of intracellular chloride ions which accumulate during excitation; cell volume changes are large. (ii) At low chloride permeability (e.g., neurons), small excitatory stimuli are sufficient to elicit APs, repetitive stimuli of equal strength produce spike trains with progressively changing amplitude, frequency and duration (short-term memory effects or non-Markovian behavior); cell volume changes are small. We hypothesize that variation of the basal chloride permeability could be an important mechanism of neuronal cells to adapt their responsiveness to external stimuli during learning and memory processes.},

abstract = {The properties of the transient outward current (Ito) differ between rabbit and human atrial myocytes. In particular, rabbit Ito is known to recover more slowly than its human counterpart and to show much more frequency dependence. To assess the possibility that these physiological differences may reflect differing expression of K+ channel subunit gene products, we used a combination of whole-cell voltage-clamp, heterologous expression, pharmacological, antisense, and Western blot techniques. The inactivation of Ito in rabbit atrial myocytes was significantly slowed by hydrogen peroxide, with human Ito being unaffected. Use-dependent unblocking with 4-aminopyridine was not seen for rabbit Ito nor for Kv1.4 currents in Xenopus oocytes, whereas human Ito showed strong use-dependent unblock (as did Kv4 currents). Western blots indicated the presence of Kv4 proteins in both human and rabbit atrial membranes, but Kv1.4 was only detected in the rabbit. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against Kv4.3, Kv4.2, or Kv1.4 subunit sequences significantly inhibited Ito current density in cultured rabbit atrial myocytes, whereas only Kv4.3 antisense significantly inhibited Ito in human cells. Neither mismatch oligodeoxynucleotides nor vehicle altered currents in either species. We conclude that, unlike human atrial myocytes, rabbit atrial myocytes express Kv1.4 channel subunits, which likely contribute to a number of important physiological differences in Ito properties between the species. To our knowledge, these studies constitute the first demonstration of a functional role for Kv1.4 channels in cardiac membranes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of an important cardiac repolarizing current.},

abstract = {The synchronization of coupled oscillators plays an important role in many biological systems, including the heart. In heart diseases, cardiac myocytes can exhibit abnormal electrical oscillations, such as early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are associated with lethal arrhythmias. A key unanswered question is how cellular EADs partially synchronize in tissue, as is required for them to propagate. Here, we present evidence, from computational simulations and experiments in isolated myocytes, that irregular EAD behavior is dynamical chaos. We then show in electrically homogeneous tissue models that chaotic EADs synchronize globally when the tissue is smaller than a critical size. However, when the tissue exceeds the critical size, electrotonic coupling can no longer globally synchronize EADs, resulting in regions of partial synchronization that shift in time and space. These regional partially synchronized EADs then form premature ventricular complexes that propagate into recovered tissue without EADs. This process creates multiple premature ventricular complexes that propagate as [corrected] "shifting" foci resembling polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Shifting foci encountering shifting repolarization gradients can also develop localized wave breaks leading to reentry and fibrillation. As predicted by the theory, rabbit hearts exposed to oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)) exhibited multiple shifting foci causing polymorphic tachycardia and fibrillation. This mechanism explains how collective cellular behavior integrates at the tissue scale to generate lethal cardiac arrhythmias over a wide range of heart rates.},

abstract = {It has been postulated that cardiac cell models accounting for changes in intracellular ion concentrations violate a conservation principle, and, as a result, computed parameters (e.g., ion concentrations and transmembrane potential, V(m)) drift in time, never attaining steady state. To address this issue, models have been proposed that invoke the charge conservation principle to calculate V(m) from ion concentrations ("algebraic" method), rather than from transmembrane current ("differential" method). The aims of this study are to compare model behavior during prolonged periods of pacing using the algebraic and differential methods, and to address the issue of model drift. We pace the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of a cardiac ventricular cell and compare the time-dependent behavior of computed parameters using the algebraic and differential methods. When ions carried by the stimulus current are taken into account, the algebraic and differential methods yield identical results and neither shows drift in computed parameters. The present study establishes the proper pacing protocol for simulation studies of cellular behavior during long periods of rapid pacing. Such studies are essential for mechanistic understanding of arrhythmogenesis, since cells are subjected to rapid periodic stimulation during many arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Clinical and experimental evidence relate action potential duration (APD) alternans to ischaemic heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias. The present investigation was performed to study the quantitative relationship between APD alternans and the degree of ischaemia, loading conditions and cycle length (CL) in an intact heart. Monophasic action potentials (MAP) were simultaneously recorded by contact electrodes from two left (LV) and one right ventricular (RV) sites in 20 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The preparations were subjected to global ischaemia at flow rates ranging from 40\% of normal flow to complete cessation of flow. Pacing was performed at either constant or regularly changing CL. The magnitude of APD alternans was expressed as beat-to-beat differences in action potential duration of two consecutive MAPs. During normal perfusion, neither very fast pacing at a CL of 200 ms nor periodical rate switches resulted in persistent APD alternans. Pacing at a constant CL of 800 ms did not induce APD alternans at complete cessation of flow for 6 min. However, alternans developed progressively at a constant CL of 400 ms after 2.8 +/- 0.3 min of complete ischaemia at the pre-loaded LV, and after 4.6 +/- 0.4 min at the unloaded RV (P < 0.01). The reduction of preload at the LV from 15 to 5 mmHg end-diastolic pressure delayed development of APD alternans from 2.8 +/- 03 min to 4.3 +/- 0.4 min (P < 0.05) at 400 ms CL. Following graded underperfusion of 40\%, 20\% and 10\% of initial flow, persistent APD alternans developed in relation to the degree of flow reduction and increased progressively with duration of ischaemia. APD alternans at the LV always preceded the onset of APD alternans at the RV. In experiments with identical flow rates the shortest CL of 200 ms resulted in the greatest and earliest initiation of APD alternans compared to the longer CL (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). An increase in CL from 400 to 800 ms immediately abolished APD alternans, generated by the shorter CL, at any time during the 6 min period of complete ischaemia. Similarly, increasing the cycle length from 200 or 400 to 600 ms eliminated APD alternans up to 6 min of ischaemia and significantly reduced its magnitude between 7 and 10 min within a few beats. We conclude that persistent APD alternans is a characteristic findings in the rabbit heart during global ischaemia4 It is a sensitive parameter of the severity of ischaemia and depends.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism for ventricular fibrillation (VF), important electrophysiological aspects of the development of VF still are poorly defined. It has been suggested that the onset of VF involves the disintegration of a single spiral wave into many self-perpetuating waves. It has been further suggested that such a process requires that the slope of the electrical restitution relation be >/=1. The same theory anticipates that a single spiral wave will be stable (not disintegrate) if the maximum slope of the restitution relation is <1. We have shown previously that the slope of the restitution relation during rapid pacing and during VF is >/=1 in canine ventricle. We now show that drugs that reduce the slope of the restitution relation (diacetyl monoxime and verapamil) prevent the induction of VF and convert existing VF into a periodic rhythm. In contrast, a drug that does not reduce the slope of the restitution relation (procainamide) does not prevent the induction of VF, nor does it regularize VF. These results indicate that the kinetics of electrical restitution is a key determinant of VF. Moreover, they suggest novel approaches to preventing the induction or maintenance of VF.},

abstract = {Action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and repolarization alternans are thought to be important arrhythmogenic factors. We investigated the role of intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) cycling in regulating APD restitution slope and repolarization (APD) alternans in patch-clamped rabbit ventricular myocytes at 34 to 36 degrees C, using the perforated or ruptured patch clamp techniques with Fura-2-AM to record Ca2+i. When APD restitution was measured by either the standard extrastimulus (S1S2) method or the dynamic rapid pacing method, the maximum APD restitution slope exceeded 1 by both methods, but was more shallow with the dynamic method. These differences were associated with greater Ca2+i accumulation during dynamic pacing. The onset of APD alternans occurred at diastolic intervals at which the APD restitution slope was significantly <1 and was abolished by suppressing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+i cycling with thapsigargin and ryanodine, or buffering the global Ca2+i transient with BAPTA-AM or BAPTA. Thapsigargin and ryanodine flattened APD restitution slope to <1 when measured by the dynamic method, but not by the S1S2 method. BAPTA-AM or BAPTA failed to flatten APD restitution slope to <1 by either method. In conclusion, APD alternans requires intact Ca2+i cycling and is not reliably predicted by APD restitution slope when Ca2+i cycling is suppressed. Ca2+i cycling may contribute to differences between APD restitution curves measured by S1S2 versus dynamic pacing protocols by inducing short-term memory effects related to pacing-dependent Ca2+i accumulation.},

abstract = {Triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) starting from damaged regions travel along multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. We have reported that octanol (100 microM) inhibits TPCs. The inhibitory effect of octanol on propagation of TPCs could be due to an effect of octanol on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mediated by Ca2+ diffusion inside the single cell or on the diffusion of Ca2+ from cell to cell via gap junctions (GJs). Therefore, we studied the regional changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) during TPCs and the effect of octanol on the permeability of gap junctions (PGJ) in rat cardiac trabeculae. [Ca2+]i was measured using electrophoretically injected fura 2 and an image-intensified charge-coupled device camera. PGJ was calculated from the diffusion coefficient for fura 2 in trabeculae (Dtrab) and in the myoplasm (Dmyop). After 1- and 3-h superfusion with 100 microM 1-octanol, Dmyop showed no significant changes, whereas Dtrab was reduced significantly. Therefore, calculated PGJ was reduced from 4.15 x 10(-5) to 2.10 x 10(-5) and 0.86 x 10(-5) cm/s, respectively. The propagation velocity of the regional increases in [Ca2+]i during TPCs was constant, averaging 1.69 +/- 1.48 mm/s (range 0.34-5.47 mm/s, n = 10). These observations support the hypothesis that TPCs are initiated near the damaged ends of trabeculae and are propagated by CICR from the sarcoplasmic reticulum mediated by diffusion of Ca2+ through cells and from cell to cell through GJs.},

abstract = {In this work, the authors use computer model- ing to investigate the mechanisms involved in figure-of-eight reentry (a pattern of excitation which may lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death) during the acute phase of regional myocardial ischemia. For this purpose, a modified version of the Luo-Rudy dynamic model for the action poten- tial and ionic currents was used, together with a two- dimensional model of the regionally ischemic ventricle. The virtual tissue comprises different realistically dimensioned transitional border zones for hyperkalemia, hypoxia and acido- sis, simulating the substrate heterogeneity created by acute ischemia. Different types of patterns of excitation following the delivery of a premature stimulus were obtained, including fig- ure-of-eight reentry. The effect of the degree of ATP-sensitive current activation, the severity of acidosis and the degree of hyperkalemia in the vulnerability to reentry were also studied. The results are in accordance with experimental observations, and demonstrate the ability of second-generation mathematical models to analyze and explain the mechanisms involved in ischemic reentry},

abstract = {Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium is associated with increases in total myocardial calcium (Ca+2), which may influence the ultimate extent of ischemic damage as well as the development of arrhythmias. Since reperfusion is also associated with enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsivity, this study was performed to determine the potential interactions between alpha-adrenergic receptors and myocardial calcium during reperfusion. Cats were subjected to 35 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 10 min of reperfusion. Total myocardial calcium was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Intracellular calcium was calculated from measurements of extracellular space [( 3H]inulin). In control animals with reperfusion, total calcium increased from 0.32 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 mmol/100 g dry tissue (P less than 0.0001), while intracellular calcium increased from 0.15 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.05 mmol/100 g dry tissue (P less than 0.001). Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic blocking agents phentolamine or prazosin prevented the increase in total and intracellular calcium. Phentolamine and the aqueous soluble alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist BE-2254 administered as late as 2 min before reperfusion similarly attenuated the increase in tissue calcium. Although administration of BE-2254 2 min before reperfusion failed to block the reperfusion-induced increase in extracellular space, the increase in calculated intracellular calcium was prevented. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol partially attenuated but did not prevent an increase in total tissue calcium. Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent completely blocked the increase in tissue calcium during reperfusion. Additional experiments performed after 70 min of ischemia with reperfusion demonstrated a 49\% attenuation of the increase in tissue calcium with alpha-adrenergic blockade. Electron microscopy with pyroantimonate and x-ray microprobe analysis demonstrated a large increase in calcium precipitate in mitochondria after reperfusion in untreated animals. Though alpha-adrenergic blockade prevented the calcium deposition in mitochondria, other criteria of ischemia persisted. Thus, alpha-adrenergic blockade specifically prevents the increase in intracellular calcium during reperfusion in reversibly injured tissue, independent of alterations in extracellular space and tissue water.},

We performed the present study to examine whether accumulation of hydrogen ion is a cause or result of accumulation of CO2. The myocardial pH and PCO2 were measured simultaneously in the dog heart, and the concentration of HCO-3 [( HCO-3]) was calculated according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Ischemia was induced by either partial or complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). After LAD occlusion, the myocardial pH decreased with a marked decrease in [HCO-3], indicating that metabolic acidosis occurred. We ascertained in experiments with blood sample in vitro that an addition of lactic acid into blood decreased both [HCO-3] and pH (metabolic acidosis), whereas an addition of CO2 gas into blood increased [HCO-3] and decreased pH (respiratory acidosis). These findings suggest that ischemic acidosis is not respiratory in nature, but metabolic. The myocardial pH decrease due to ischemia, however, cannot be explained by the tissue lactate accumulation alone, because the decrease of [HCO-3] is far greater than the increase of lactic acid during ischemia.},

@article{Jalife2009,
abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most important cause of sudden cardiac death. While traditionally thought to result from random activation of the ventricles by multiple independent wavelets, recent evidence suggests that VF may be determined by the sustained activation of a relatively small number of reentrant sources. In addition, recent experimental data in various species as well as computer simulations have provided important clues about its ionic and molecular mechanisms, particularly in regards to the role of potassium currents in such mechanisms. The results strongly argue that the inward rectifier current, I(K1,) is an important current during functional reentry because it mediates the electrotonic interactions between the unexcited core and its immediate surroundings. In addition, I(K1) is a stabilizer of reentry due to its ability to shorten action potential duration and reduce conduction velocity near the center of rotation. Increased I(K1) prevents wave front-wave tail interactions and thus averts rotor destabilization and breakup. Other studies have shown that while the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current I(Ks) does not significantly modify rotor frequency or stability, it plays a major role in postrepolarization refractoriness and wave break formation. Therefore, the interplay between I(K1) and the rapid sodium inward current (I(Na)) is a major factor in the control of cardiac excitability and thus the stability and frequency of reentry, while I(Ks) is an important determinant of fibrillatory conduction.},

abstract = {The effect of the coronary perfusion pressure on myocardial distensibility was studied in 11 open-chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated, and coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow were measured. Regional myocardial segment length was measured using sonomicrometers. The temporal relationship between the phasic coronary pressure fall and change in myocardial segment length was analyzed during the early phase of coronary occlusion. Diastolic myocardial segment length was completely unaffected by the substantial fall in coronary pressure over a period of 9.3 +/- 0.8 s (20 +/- 2 heart beats). During this period, coronary pressure fell from 98 +/- 7 to 28 +/- 2 mm Hg. Subsequently, diastolic segment length increased, presumably due to ischemia rather than to a delayed compliance change. In order to differentiate between a possible long-time constant for coupling of the intravascular pressure to myocardial compliance versus a primary ischemic effect, regional cardiac contraction was abolished by an intracoronary potassium chloride infusion in three dogs. Coronary occlusion during regional cardioplegia produced no further segment length changes for a 1-min period, effectively excluding viscoelastic coupling time constants of up to 1 min. From these results we conclude that the coronary distending pressure does not contribute to passive myocardial properties over the physiological perfusion pressure range, and that the "garden hose" effect is not operative for the in vivo working heart.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of patients at risk for drug-induced torsades de pointes arrhythmia (TdP) is difficult. Increased temporal lability of repolarization has been suggested as being valuable to predict proarrhythmia. The predictive value of different repolarization parameters, including beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR), was compared in this serial investigation in dogs with chronic AV block. METHODS AND RESULTS: In anesthetized dogs with electrically remodeled hearts, the dose-dependent difference in drug-induced TdP (d-sotalol, 2 and 4 mg/kg IV over 5 minutes, 25\% and 75\% TdP, respectively) could not be accounted for by prolongation of QT(c) (410+/-37 to 475+/-60 versus 415+/-47 to 484+/-52 ms, respectively). BVR was quantified by Poincare plots at baseline and immediately before onset of d-sotalol-induced extrasystolic activity. TdP occurrence was associated with an increase in short-term variability (STV) of the left ventricular monophasic action potential duration (3.5+/-1.5 to 5.5+/-1.6 versus 3.0+/-0.7 to 8.6+/-3.8 ms, respectively), which was reversible when TdP was abolished by I(K,ATP) activation. The absence of TdP despite QT(c) prolongation after chronic amiodarone treatment could also be explained by an unchanged STV. In experiments with isolated ventricular myocytes, STV increased after I(Kr) block and was highest in cells that subsequently showed early afterdepolarizations. CONCLUSIONS: Proarrhythmia is not related to differences in prolongation of repolarization but corresponds to BVR, here quantified as STV of the left ventricle. STV could be a new parameter to predict drug-induced TdP in patients.},

abstract = {Cardiac fibrillation (spontaneous, asynchronous contractions of cardiac muscle fibres) is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, yet it is not clear how it occurs. It has been debated whether or not fibrillation is a random phenomenon. There is some determinism during fibrillation, perhaps resulting from rotating waves of electrical activity. Here we present a new algorithm that markedly reduces the amount of data required to depict the complex spatiotemporal patterns of fibrillation. We use a potentiometric dye and video imaging to record the dynamics of transmembrane potentials at many sites during fibrillation. Transmembrane signals at each site exhibit a strong periodic component centred near 8 Hz. This periodicity is seen as an attractor in two-dimensional-phase space and each site can be represented by its phase around the attractor. Spatial phase maps at each instant reveal the 'sources' of fibrillation in the form of topological defects, or phase singularities, at a few sites. Using our method of identifying phase singularities, we can elucidate the mechanisms for the formation and termination of these singularities, and represent an episode of fibrillation by locating singularities. Our results indicate an unprecedented amount of temporal and spatial organization during cardiac fibrillation.},

abstract = {How is the heartbeat generated? What controls the strength of contraction of heart muscle? What are the links between cardiac structure and function? How does our understanding of skeletal and smooth muscle and non-muscle cells influence our thinking about force development in the heart? Are there important species differences in how contraction is regulated in the heart? How do the new molecular data fit together in understanding the heart beat? What goes wrong in ischemia, hypertrophy, and heart failure? This book paints a modern `portrait' of how the heart works and in this picture the author shows a close-up of the structural, biochemical, and physiological links between excitation and contraction. The author takes the reader through a series of important, interrelated topics with great clarity and continuity and also includes many useful illustrations and tables. The book starts by considering the cellular structures involved in excitation-contraction coupling and then described the characteristics of the myofilaments as the end effector of excitation-contraction coupling. A general scheme of calcium regulation is described and the possible sources and sinks of calcium are discussed in simple, but quantitative terms. The cardiac action potential and its many underlying currents are reviewed. Then the characteristics of some key calcium transport systems (calcium channels, sodium/calcium exchange and SR calcium uptake and release) are discussed in detail. This is then built into a more integrated picture of calcium regulation in succeeding chapters by detailed discussions of excitation-calcium coupling mechanisms (in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle), the interplay between calcium regulatory processes, and finally mechanisms of cardiac inotropy, calcium overload, and dysfunction (e.g., ischemia, hypertrophy, and heart failure). Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force \&endash; Second Edition is an invaluable source of information for anyone who is interested in how the heart beat is controlled and especially suited for students of the cardiovascular system at all levels from medical/graduate students through senior investigators in related fields.},

The changes that cause ischemic injury to become irreversible are discussed in detail because these changes are the target of any successful therapy designed to prevent ischemic cell death. Of these, the disruption of the sarcolemma, an injury the development of which is accelerated in vivo by the contraction of viable tissue elsewhere in the heart traumatizing the ischemic area, plus the changes in high-energy phosphate and the total adenine nucleotide pool are considered to be the critical events leading to the development of irreversibility. The discovery of preconditioning with ischemia is discussed, together with a brief description of postconditioning. Finally, reperfusion injury is discussed in a summary fashion. The evidence for the fact that myocytes are salvaged by reperfusion is presented, as is the evidence that myocytes become unsalvageable by reperfusion as the duration of ischemia increases. The concept that some of the myocytes that die after successful reperfusion with arterial blood actually are killed by changes initiated by reperfusion, so-called lethal reperfusion injury, is attractive in that prevention of this change would lead to greater salvage; however, the prevalence of this phenomenon in clinical practice remains to be determined.},

@article{Terkildsen2007,
abstract = {Ischemia-induced hyperkalemia (accumulation of extracellular K(+)) predisposes the heart to the development of lethal reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. This phenomenon exhibits a triphasic time course and is thought to be mediated by a combination of three mechanisms: 1) increased cellular K(+) efflux, 2) decreased cellular K(+) influx, and 3) shrinkage of the extracellular space. These ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes are driven by an impaired cellular metabolism. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms, as well as the origin of the triphasic profile, have proven to be difficult to determine experimentally. In this study, the changes in metabolite concentrations that arise during 15 min of zero-flow global ischemia were incorporated into a dynamic model of cellular electrophysiology, which was extended to include a metabolically sensitive description of the Na(+)-K(+) pump and ATP-sensitive K(+) channel, in addition to cell volume regulation. The coupling of altered K(+) fluxes and cell volume regulation enables an integrative simulation of ischemic hyperkalemia. These simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce experimental measurements of the accumulation of extracellular K(+) during 15 min of simulated ischemia, both with respect to the degree of K(+) loss as well as the triphasic time course. Analysis of the model indicates that the inhibition of the Na(+)-K(+) pump is the dominant factor underlying this hyperkalemic behavior, accounting for approximately 85\% of the observed extracellular K(+) accumulation. It was found that the balance between activation and inhibition of the Na(+)-K(+) pump, affected by the changing metabolite and ion concentrations (in particular, [ADP]), give rise to the triphasic profile associated with ischemic hyperkalemia.},

Because the presence of UB implies spatial asymmetry in some property along the strand, we varied membrane properties (gNa or leakage conductance), cell diameter, or intercellular resistance as functions of distance such that a propagating action potential encountered the parameter changes either gradually or abruptly. For changes in membrane properties there was very little difference in the effects on propagation for the gradual or abrupt encounter; but, for changes in cell diameter or in intercellular resistance, there were large differences leading to the production of UB over a wide range of parameter values.},

@article{Wilson2006,
abstract = {Essentially all previous research on alternans has been restricted to normal myocardium, whereas sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs most commonly in patients with ventricular dysfunction (i.e., heart failure), which is associated with marked disruption of proteins responsible for normal calcium cycling in myocytes. Several lines of evidence from studies in normal hearts suggest a link between impaired calcium cycling which characterizes ventricular mechanical dysfunction and impaired calcium cycling that is responsible for alternans. In normal myocardium, cells which exhibit the slowest calcium cycling, and not the slowest repolarization, are most susceptible to alternans. Decreased expression of key calcium cycling proteins is observed in alternans-prone cells. Sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA2a) expression is decreased, suggesting a mechanism for the slower sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium reuptake observed in alternans-prone cells. In addition, diminished ryanodine receptor (RyR) function leading to abnormal calcium release from the SR is also linked to cellular alternans. Although impaired contractile function clearly predisposes to SCD, the mechanisms linking mechanical to electrophysiological dysfunction in the heart are unclear. We propose that cellular calcium alternans may be an important mechanism linking mechanical dysfunction to cardiac arrhythmogenesis.},

abstract = {Rationale: Preclinical studies indicate adult stem cells induce tissue repair by activating endogenous stem cells through the SDF-1:CXCR4 axis. JVS-100 is a DNA plasmid encoding human SDF-1.Objective: Test in a Phase I open-label dose-escalation study with 12 months follow-up in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IsCM) to see if JVS-100 improves clinical parameters.Methods and Results: Seventeen subjects with IsCM, NYHA Class III heart failure, with an ejection fraction ≤ 40\% on stable medical therapy were enrolled to receive 5, 15 or 30 mg of JVS-100 via endomyocardial injection. The primary endpoints for safety and efficacy were at 1 and 4 months, respectively. The primary safety endpoint was major adverse cardiac events. Efficacy endpoints were change in quality of life (QOL), NYHA Class, 6 minute walk distance (6MWd), SPECT, NT-proBNP and echocardiography at 4 and 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was met. At 4 months, all cohorts demonstrated improvements in 6MWd, QOL and NYHA class. Subjects in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose groups exhibited improvements in 6MWd (15 mg: Median [Range]: 41 [3 to 61] m, 30 mg: 31 [22 to 74] m) and QOL (15 mg: -16 [+1 to -32] points; 30 mg: -24 [+17 to -38] points) over baseline. At 12 months improvements in symptoms were maintained.Conclusions: These data highlight the importance of defining the molecular mechanisms of stem cell based tissue repair and suggest that over-expression of SDF-1 via gene therapy is a strategy for improving heart failure symptoms in patients with IsCM.},

abstract = {Ionic mechanisms of early afterdepolarization (EAD) induced by the K(+)-free solution or veratridine were studied with guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the patch-clamp technique of whole-cell and cell-attached patch configurations. In the K(+)-free solution, myocytes exhibited prolonged action potential duration with humps on the final repolarization phase, which eventually turned into EAD starting around -70 mV and induced triggered activity. Application of 0.5 mM Cd2+ inhibited the development of EAD and caused depolarization of maximum diastolic potentials around -30 mV, although Cd2+ did not prevent prolongation of the action potential. Application of 50-100 microM Ni2+ or 30 microM tetrodotoxin had little effects on EAD and diastolic potentials. The background current-voltage relation examined by a ramp voltage clamp showed inhibition of the inward rectifier K+ current, induction of steady inward current between -40 and -10 mV, and increase in the outward tail current upon repolarization in the K(+)-free solution. Cd2+ completely blocked the steady inward current at the plateau level and partially depressed the delayed outward K+ current, while Ni2+ had no effects on the background I-V relation. Tetrodotoxin showed a mild inhibitory effect on the inward component of the background current negative to -50 mV, but left the steady inward current at the plateau level. Therefore, EAD in the K(+)-free condition is mainly formed by decreased inward rectifier K+ current, activation of the L-type Ca2+ current, and time-dependent decay of the delayed outward K+ current upon repolarization. Application of 25-100 microM veratridine caused marked prolongation of action potential with appearance of regenerative EADs. Action potential prolongation and EADs were partially abolished by Cd2+ and completely eliminated by tetrodotoxin. The single channel current recordings showed a decreased current amplitude, and prolonged and delayed openings of the Na+ channel currents by veratridine. Thus, an ensemble average current showed markedly prolonged decay time constant of 609 msec in veratridine from 3.6 msec in the control. These results indicate that veratridine-induced EAD is mainly formed by altered properties of the Na+ channel current and partly by the L-type Ca2+ current due to slowed repolarization. Thus, EAD can be induced by different ionic mechanisms depending on the basal conditions.},

abstract = {Inheritable long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disease in which delayed ventricular repolarization leads to cardiac arrhythmias and the possibility of sudden death. In the chromosome 3-linked disease, one mutation of the cardiac Na+ channel gene results in a deletion of residues 1505 to 1507 (Delta KPQ), and two mutation result in substitutions (N1325S and R1644H). We compared all three mutant-channel phenotypes by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Each produced a late phase of inactivation-resistant, mexiletine- and tetrodotoxin-sensitive whole-cell currents, but the underlying mechanisms were different at the single-channel level. N1325S and R1644H showed dispersed reopenings after the initial transient, whereas Delta KPQ showed both dispersed reopenings and long-lasting bursts. Thus, two distinct biophysical defects underlie the in vitro phenotype of persistent current in Na+ channel-linked LQTS, and the additive effects of both are responsible for making the Delta KPQ phenotype the most severe.},

abstract = {Computer models have proved to be invaluable to experimental and theoretical research in cardiac electrophysiology, and several environments have been designed to aim at easing the development of such models. Recent advances in computing have made the development of graphical user interfaces much simpler, which has lead to the arrival of new software packages that are used primarily for teaching, not research. Here, we introduce Cellular Open Resource (COR), a modeling environment that runs under Microsoft Windows® and that can be used for both research and teaching. It is built around CellMLTM, which provides COR with "out of the box" access to an increasing database of single cell models. Though COR was initially developed to handle cardiac modeling, it may also be applied to other types of reaction (and diffusion) problems. The interface is designed with user friendliness in mind (e.g. an equation viewer can be used to graphically visualize an equation as it would appear in a publication). All the cell models used in a single cell or a multicellular problem are checked for correctness, before being dynamically compiled and converted into machine code, in order to maximize computing efficiency. The computation of a problem is both interactive and event-driven. One can, thus, modify the properties of a problem at any point in time and/or subject to a particular condition.

abstract = {Stretching of cardiac muscle modulates contraction through the enhancement of the Ca2+ transient, but how this occurs is still not known. We found that stretching of myocytes modulates the elementary Ca2+ release process from ryanodine-receptor Ca2+-release channels (RyRCs), Ca2+ sparks and the electrically stimulated Ca2+ transient. Stretching induces PtdIns-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-dependent phosphorylation of both Akt and the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO) production, and a proportionate increase in Ca2+-spark frequency that is abolished by inhibiting NOS and PI(3)K. Exogenously generated NO reversibly increases Ca2+-spark frequency without cell stretching. We propose that myocyte NO produced by activation of the PI(3)K-Akt-endothelial NOS axis acts as a second messenger of stretch by enhancing RyRC activity, contributing to myocardial contractile activation.},

abstract = {A monoclonal antibody (mAb 4B4) was raised against purified sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from canine myocardium, and shown to inhibit Ca2+ uptake by microsomes isolated from cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. The amount of mAb 4B4 needed to inhibit the Ca2+ uptake 50\% at a given membrane concentration correlated with the amount of Ca2+ pump protein in the microsomal preparation. This is consistent with the observation the mAb 4B4 binds specifically to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (Mr 100 kDa), but has no effect on the T-tubule Mg2+-ATPase. Changes in the binding of mAb 4B4 to crude microsomes isolated from dog heart after various durations of global ischemia showed that the decrease in microsomal Ca2+ transport during the first 15 min of ischemia correlated with a loss of active Ca2+ pump molecules. The monoclonal antibody mAb 4B4 may therefore serve as a specific marker for the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump system in various cells, and can provide quantitative information about the loss of active Ca2+ pump proteins under pathological conditions.},

Sinus rate was increased in rabbits dying suddenly, but was decreased in survivors. This also was true in isolated preparations. Microelectrode recordings from ventricular trabeculae both from patients with end-stage failure and from failing rabbits showed that in half of the preparations, delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity occurred, but only in the presence of norepinephrine and a lowered extracellular K+ concentration of 3 mM. This was due to spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {In vivo studies have suggested that increased beat-to-beat variability of ventricular repolarization duration (BVR) is a better predictor of drug-induced torsades de pointes than repolarization prolongation alone. Cellular BVR and its dynamics before proarrhythmic events are poorly understood. We investigated differential responses of BVR in single myocytes during I(Ks) blockade versus I(Kr) blockade and late-I(Na) augmentation, under the influence of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Transmembrane action potentials were recorded from isolated canine left-ventricular midmyocytes at various pacing rates. I(Ks) was blocked by HMR1556, I(Kr) by dofetilide. Late I(Na) was augmented by sea anemone toxin-II. Isoproterenol was added for beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. BAPTA-AM buffered intracellular Ca(2+). SEA0400 partially inhibited the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger. BVR was quantified as variability of action-potential duration at 90\% repolarization: Sigma(|APD90; i+1 minus APD90; i|)/[nbeatsx radical2] for 30 consecutive action potentials. Baseline BVR was significantly increased by I(Kr) blockade and late-I(Na) augmentation, especially at slow pacing rates. beta-adrenergic stimulation restabilized these BVR changes. In contrast, I(Ks) blockade caused very little change in repolarization when compared to baseline conditions, but predisposed the myocyte to increased BVR during beta-adrenergic stimulation, especially at fast rates. BAPTA-AM and SEA0400 reduced this excessive BVR and eliminated early afterdepolarizations. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation exaggerates BVR during I(Ks) blockade, indicating a BVR-stabilizing role of beta-adrenergic-sensitive I(Ks). Loss of I(Ks) plus overriding of Ca(2+)-dependent membrane currents, including inward Na(+)-Ca(2)(+) exchange current, conspire to proarrhythmic BVR under these conditions.},

abstract = {Parameters for models of biological systems are often obtained by averaging over experimental results from a number of different preparations. To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

abstract = {An envelope of tails test was used to show that the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) of guinea pig ventricular myocytes results from the activation of two outward K+ currents. One current was specifically blocked by the benzenesulfonamide antiarrhythmic agent, E-4031 (IC50 = 397 nM). The drug-sensitive current, "IKr" exhibits prominent rectification and activates very rapidly relative to the slowly activating drug-insensitive current, "IKs." IKs was characterized by a delayed onset of activation that occurs over a voltage range typical of the classically described cardiac IK. Fully activated IKs, measured as tail current after 7.5-s test pulses, was 11.4 times larger than the fully activated IKr. IKr was also blocked by d-sotalol (100 microM), a less potent benzenesulfonamide Class III antiarrhythmic agent. The activation curve of IKr had a steep slope (+7.5 mV) and a negative half-point (-21.5 mV) relative to the activation curve of IKs (slope = +12.7 mV, half-point = +15.7 mV). The reversal potential (Erev) of IKr (-93 mV) was similar to EK (-94 mV for [K+]o = 4 mM), whereas Erev of IKs was -77 mV. The time constants for activation and deactivation of IKr made up a bell-shaped function of membrane potential, peaking between -30 and -40 mV (170 ms). The slope conductance of the linear portion of the fully activated IKr-V relation was 22.5 S/F. Inward rectification of this relation occurred at potentials greater than -50 mV, resulting in a voltage-dependent decrease in peak IKr at test potentials greater than 0 mV. Peak IKr at 0 mV averaged 0.8 pA/pF (n = 21). Although the magnitude of IKr was small relative to fully activated IKs, the two currents were of similar magnitude when measured during a relatively short pulse protocol (225 ms) at membrane potentials (-20 to +20 mV) typical of the plateau phase of cardiac action potentials.},

abstract = {Neurons, and realistic models of neurons, typically express several different types of voltage-gated conductances. These conductances are subject to continual regulation. Therefore it is essential to understand how changes in the conductances of a neuron affect its intrinsic properties, such as burst period or delay to firing after inhibition of a particular duration and magnitude. Even in model neurons, it can be difficult to visualize how the intrinsic properties vary as a function of their underlying maximal conductances. We used a technique, called clutter-based dimension reordering (CBDR), which enabled us to visualize intrinsic properties in high-dimensional conductance spaces. We applied CBDR to a family of models with eight different types of voltage- and calcium-dependent channels. CBDR yields images that reveal structure in the underlying conductance space. CBDR can also be used to visualize the results of other types of analysis. As examples, we use CBDR to visualize the results of a connected-components analysis, and to visually evaluate the results of a separating-hyperplane (i.e., linear classifier) analysis. We believe that CBDR will be a useful tool for visualizing the conductance spaces of neuronal models in many systems.},

The interpretation of this nonlinear HRV behavior, resulting from interactions between extracardiac regulatory mechanisms, could be clinically useful. However, the involvement of intrinsic variations of pacemaker rate in HRV has scarcely been investigated. We examined beating variability in spontaneously active incubating cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes using microelectrode arrays. In networks of mathematical model pacemaker cells, we evaluated the variability induced by the stochastic gating of transmembrane currents and of calcium release channels and by the dynamic turnover of ion channels. In the cultures, spontaneous activity originated from a mobile focus. Both the beat-to-beat movement of the focus and beat rate variability exhibited a power law behavior. In the model networks, stochastic fluctuations in transmembrane currents and stochastic gating of calcium release channels did not reproduce the spatiotemporal patterns observed in vitro. In contrast, long-term correlations produced by the turnover of ion channels induced variability patterns with a power law behavior similar to those observed experimentally. Therefore, phenomena leading to long-term correlated variations in pacemaker cellular function may, in conjunction with extracardiac regulatory mechanisms, contribute to the nonlinear characteristics of HRV.},

abstract = {Several cardioactive agents exhibit direct or reverse rate-dependent effects on action potential duration (APD) depending on the experimental conditions. Recently, a new theory has been proposed, suggesting that the reverse rate-dependent mode of drug-action may be a common property of canine, rabbit, guinea pig and human cardiac tissues, and this phenomenon is based on the dependence of drug-action on baseline APD. The aim of the present work was to examine the limitations of this hypothesis by studying the APD lengthening effect of K+ channel blockers and the APD shortening effect of Ca2+ channel blockers during the electrical restitution process of rat ventricular action potentials. Rat ventricular muscle was chosen because it has a set of ion currents markedly different from those of other species, its APD is shorter by one order of magnitude than that of the “plateau-forming” larger mammals, and most importantly, its APD increases at higher heart rates – opposite to many other species. The restitution of APD was studied as a function of the diastolic interval, a parameter indicating the proximity of action potentials. It was found that drug-induced APD changes in rat myocardium are proportional with the pre-drug value of APD but not with the diastolic interval, indicating that not the proximity of consecutive action potentials, but the baseline APD itself may determine the magnitude of drug-induced APD changes.},

abstract = {Abstract Anion conductance is known to be activated by mechanical stimulation, such as osmotic cell swelling or cell inflation via the patch pipette, of canine or rabbit cardiac myocytes. The effects of mechanical stimulation on time-dependent currents, however, remain unsettled. Using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method, we have found that mechanical stimuli enhance the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) in rabbit cardiac myocytes. At every membrane potential, ICa,L was reversibly increased by osmotic cell swelling and by cell inflation caused by applying a positive pressure of 10 to 15 cm H2O via the patch pipette. ICa,L was increased during cell inflation by 37\{+/-\}21\% (mean\{+/-\}SD, n=17) in atrial cells and by 37\{+/-\}8\% (n=7) in sinoatrial node cells in solution containing 2 mmol/L Ca2+. The current-voltage relationship, the inactivation time constant, the steady state inactivation curve, and the conductance properties of ICa,L were all virtually unaffected by mechanical stimulation except for the open probability, which appears to increase. The increase in ICa,L was not dependent on protein kinase A, since an inhibitor peptide of cAMP-dependent protein kinase failed to prevent the increase in ICa,L during mechanical stimuli (n=5). The increase in ICa,L caused by cell inflation was unaffected by the chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by the addition of 10 mmol/L EGTA or 10 mmol/L BAPTA to the pipette solution, suggesting that the effect was not mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+. Thus, mechanical stimulation due to cell swelling or inflation may itself directly increase ICa,L in rabbit cardiac myocytes.},

The slow component of inactivation was unchanged, whereas the fast component was accelerated after colchicine treatment (at -10 mV, 11.8+/-1.0 versus 6.7+/-1.0 ms in control versus colchicine-treated cells; P<0.005). [Ca(2+)](i) transients were analyzed by fluo-3 epifluorescence simultaneously with I(Ca). Peak [Ca(2+)](i) transients were significantly increased in cardiac myocytes treated with colchicine. The values of F/F(0) at 0 mV were 1.1+/-0.02 in 9 control cells and 1.4+/-0.1 in 11 colchicine-treated cells (P<0.05). beta-Adrenergic stimulation with 1 micromol/L isoproterenol increased both I(Ca) and [Ca(2+)](i) transient in control cells. However, no significant change was induced by isoproterenol on colchicine-treated cells. Colchicine and isoproterenol effects were similar and not additive. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by 200 micromol/L 2'-deoxyadenosine 3'-monophosphate blunted the colchicine effect. We suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation and microtubule disruption share a common pathway to enhance I(Ca) and [Ca(2+)](i) transient.},

abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

abstract = {The cardiac sodium current was studied in guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the cell-attached patch voltage clamp at 37 degrees C in the presence of 145 mM external sodium concentration. When using large patch pipettes (access resistance, 1-2 M omega), the capacity current transient duration was typically 70 microseconds for voltage clamp steps up to 150 mV. At 37 degrees C the maximum inward sodium current peaked in approximately 200 microseconds after the onset of a clamp step and at this strong depolarization, less than 10\% of the sodium current developed during the capacity transient. The sodium current developed smoothly and the descending limb of the current-voltage relationship usually spanned a range of 40 mV. Moreover, currents reduced by inactivation of sodium channels could be scaled to superimpose on the maximum current. Current tails elicited by deactivation followed a monoexponential time course that was very similar for currents of different sizes. Data obtained over a range of temperatures (15 degrees-35 degrees C) showed that the steady-state inactivation and conductance-voltage curves were shifted to more negative voltages at lower temperatures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of investigating the sodium current of mammalian cardiac cells at 37 degrees C in normal physiological solutions.},

abstract = {Although expression of numerous ion channels is altered in heart failure (HF), mechanisms by which dysfunction at the ionic and molecular levels lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias in HF are unknown. Previously, we found that transmural heterogeneities of repolarization play a critical role in the genesis of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) when QT interval was prolonged in LQT2. Because QT interval is also prolonged in HF, we hypothesized that transmural heterogeneities are a mechanism of PVT in HF. Optical action potentials were measured simultaneously from cells spanning the entire transmural wall of arterially perfused canine wedge preparations. Wedges were isolated from dogs without (control, n=5) and with HF (n=8) produced by rapid ventricular pacing. In HF, action potential duration (APD) prolongation was markedly heterogeneous across the transmural wall, and was characterized by disproportionate APD prolongation of midmyocardial (M) cells. APD prolongation of M cells accounted for QT-interval prolongation, and caused significant increases (P<0.01) in spatial gradients of repolarization across the ventricular wall from 4.3+/-2.1 (control) to 12.4+/-3.5 ms/mm (HF). Enhanced gradients were directly responsible for development of functional conduction block, leading to PVT in 63\% of HF wedges but in no controls (P<0.03). Moreover, intramural decremental conduction and block of the premature impulse, preceded each episode of PVT, and always occurred at the border between M-cell and subepicardial zones, where repolarization gradients were highest. Selective prolongation of APD within M cells underlies several key features of the HF phenotype, including QT-interval prolongation, transmural heterogeneity of repolarization, and susceptibility to conduction block and reentrant PVT.},

abstract = {Heart failure constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. The electrophysiological remodeling of failing hearts sets the stage for malignant arrhythmias, in which the role of the late Na(+) current (I(NaL)) is relevant and is currently under investigation. In this study we examined the role of I(NaL) in the electrophysiological phenotype of ventricular myocytes, and its proarrhythmic effects in the failing heart. A model for cellular heart failure was proposed using a modified version of Grandi et al. model for human ventricular action potential that incorporates the formulation of I(NaL). A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed and simulations of the pathological electrical activity of the cell were conducted. The proposed model for the human I(NaL) and the electrophysiological remodeling of myocytes from failing hearts accurately reproduce experimental observations. The sensitivity analysis of the modulation of electrophysiological parameters of myocytes from failing hearts due to ion channels remodeling, revealed a role for I(NaL) in the prolongation of action potential duration (APD), triangulation of the shape of the AP, and changes in Ca(2+) transient. A mechanistic investigation of intracellular Na(+) accumulation and APD shortening with increasing frequency of stimulation of failing myocytes revealed a role for the Na(+)/K(+) pump, the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and I(NaL). The results of the simulations also showed that in failing myocytes, the enhancement of I(NaL) increased the reverse rate-dependent APD prolongation and the probability of initiating early afterdepolarizations. The electrophysiological remodeling of failing hearts and especially the enhancement of the I(NaL) prolong APD and alter Ca(2+) transient facilitating the development of early afterdepolarizations. An enhanced I(NaL) appears to be an important contributor to the electrophysiological phenotype and to the dysregulation of [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis of failing myocytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although T-wave alternans has been closely associated with vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias, the cellular processes underlying T-wave alternans and their role, if any, in the mechanism of reentry remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: -T-wave alternans on the surface ECG was elicited in 8 Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts during fixed-rate pacing while action potentials were recorded simultaneously from 128 epicardial sites with voltage-sensitive dyes. Alternans of the repolarization phase of the action potential was observed above a critical threshold heart rate (HR) (209+/-46 bpm) that was significantly lower (by 57+/-36 bpm) than the HR threshold for alternation of action potential depolarization. The magnitude (range, 2.7 to 47.0 mV) and HR threshold (range, 171 to 272 bpm) of repolarization alternans varied substantially between cells across the epicardial surface. T-wave alternans on the surface ECG was explained primarily by beat-to-beat alternation in the time course of cellular repolarization. Above a critical HR, membrane repolarization alternated with the opposite phase between neighboring cells (ie, discordant alternans), creating large spatial gradients of repolarization. In the presence of discordant alternans, a small acceleration of pacing cycle length produced a characteristic sequence of events: (1) unidirectional block of an impulse propagating against steep gradients of repolarization, (2) reentrant propagation, and (3) the initiation of ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Repolarization alternans at the level of the single cell accounts for T-wave alternans on the surface ECG. Discordant alternans produces spatial gradients of repolarization of sufficient magnitude to cause unidirectional block and reentrant ventricular fibrillation. These data establish a mechanism linking T-wave alternans of the ECG to the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {The calcium sensitivity of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) was investigated in guinea pig single ventricular cells using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with a cell dialysis method. The concentration-response curve of IK for intracellular Ca2+ indicated that IK started to increase at intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i of 10(-8) M (pCa 8) and it increased threefold at pCa 7. At lower [Ca2+]i than pCa 9, IK remained unchanged. A shift of the activation curve of IK by the elevation of [Ca2+]i was not observed. Although [Ca2+]i had little effect on time constants of the activation and deactivation of IK, it predominantly increased the amplitudes of the fast components in the activation process and the slow component in the deactivation process. In the ensemble noise analysis, the elevation of [Ca2+]i increased the number and open probability of functional IK channels but not the unit amplitude of IK channel. These results suggest that the elevation of [Ca2+]i enhances IK, probably by increasing the number and open probability of functional IK channels. Ca2(+)-sensitive IK in cardiac cells is a class of current different from Ca2(+)-activated K+ current in other tissue because the activation curve of Ca2(+)-sensitive IK was not shifted by the [Ca2+]i elevation, and the single channel conductance of IK was smaller than the one of Ca2(+)-activated K+ current.},

abstract = {Sodium channel blockers are associated with arrhythmic sudden death, although they are considered antiarrhythmic agents. The mechanism of these opposing effects is unknown. We used a model of induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) based on selective perfusion of the vascular beds of isolated porcine hearts (n = 8). One bed was perfused with sotalol (220 $\mu$M), the adjacent bed with pinacidil (80 $\mu$M), leading to repolarization heterogeneity (late repolarization in the sotalol-, early in the pinacidil-area). Premature stimulation from the area with the short action potential was performed. Epicardial activation/repolarization mapping was done. In three of the eight hearts VF was inducible prior to infusion of flecainide. In those hearts the Fibrillation Factor (FF), the interval between the earliest repolarization of the premature beat (S2) in the early repolarizing (pinacidil) domain, and the last S2-activation in the late repolarizing (sotalol) domain, was significantly shorter than in the hearts without VF (33 ± 22 vs 93 ± 11 ms, m ± SEM, p < 0.05). In the three hearts with VF flecainide was infused in the pinacidil domain after defibrillation. This led to shortening of the line of block, local delay of S2 activation and repolarization, an increase in FF and failure to induce VF. In the five hearts without VF, flecainide was subsequently infused in the sotalol domain. This led to a local delay of S2 activation, a shortening of FF (by 47 ± 3 ms) and successful induction of VF in three hearts. In the two remaining hearts FF did not decrease enough (maximally 13 ms) to allow re-entry. Sodium channel blockade applied to myocardium with a short refractory period is antifibrillatory whereas sodium channel blockade of myocardium with a long refractory period is profibrillatory. Our study provides a mechanistic basis for pro- and antiarrhythmic effects of sodium channel blockers in the absence of structural heart disease.},

METHODS: A myocardial infarction was induced by surgical coronary artery ligation in heterozygous IGF-1 deficient mice. One week after surgery, left ventricular function was analyzed, and parameters of cardiac remodeling were measured. RESULTS: No significant difference in cardiac function was found between infarcted wildtype and knock-out animals, despite a marked reduction in capillarization and blunting of the hypertrophic response of the interventricular septum in the IGF-1 deficient group. Furthermore, decreased DNA synthesis and increased apoptosis rates were observed in the IGF-1 knock-out mice.

When coronary flow was reduced to 20 and 10\% of control, diastolic F385/456 increased by 14 +/- 3 and 39 +/- 5\%, respectively. Although developed pressure markedly decreased when coronary flow was reduced, there was no change of the F385/456 transient amplitude (systolic minus diastolic).

Here, we review the role of aberrant intracellular Ca handling, ionic imbalances associated with acute myocardial ischemia, neurohumoral changes, and genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of SCD due to cardiac arrhythmia. Therapeutic measures to prevent SCD are also discussed.},

abstract = {Ventricular dilatation increases the defibrillation threshold (DFT). In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this increase, the present article investigates changes in the postshock behavior of the myocardium upon stretch. A two-dimensional electro-mechanical model of cardiac tissue incorporating heterogeneous fiber orientation was used to explore the effect of sustained stretch on postshock behavior via (a) recruitment of mechanosensitive channels (MSC) and (b) tissue deformation and concomitant changes in tissue conductivities. Recruitment of MSC had no influence on vulnerability to electric shocks as compared to control, but increased the complexity of postshock VF patterns. Stretch-induced deformation and changes in tissue conductivities resulted in a decrease in vulnerability to electric shocks.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death is mainly provoked by arrhythmogenic processes. During myocardial ischemia many malignant arrhythmias, such as reentry, take place and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. It is thus of great interest to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying the initiation and maintenance of a reentry. In this computational study, we analyze the probability of reentry during different stages of the acute phase of ischemia. We also aimed at the understanding of the role of its main components: hypoxia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis analyzing the intricate ionic mechanisms responsible for reentry generation. We simulated the electrical activity of a ventricular tissue affected by regional ischemia based on a modified version of the Luo-Rudy model (LRd00). The ischemic conditions were varied to simulate different stages of this pathology. After premature stimulation, we evaluated the vulnerability to reentry. We obtained an unimodal behavior for the vulnerable window as ischemia progressed, peaking at the eighth minute after the onset of ischemia where the vulnerable window yielded 58 ms. Under more severe conditions the vulnerable window decreased and became zero for minute 8.75. The present work provides insight into the mechanisms of reentry generation during ischemia, highlighting the role of acidosis and hypoxia when hyperkalemia is present.},

abstract = {Myocardial ischemia leads to significant changes in the intracellular and extracellular ionic milieu, high-energy phosphate compounds, and accumulation of metabolic by-products. Changes are measured in extracellular pH and K+, and intracellular pH, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate. Alterations of membrane currents occur as a consequence of these ionic changes, adrenergic receptor stimulation, and accumulation of lactate, amphipathic compounds, and adenosine. Changes in the volume of the extracellular and intracellular spaces contribute further to the ultimate perturbations of active and passive membrane properties that underlie alterations in excitability, abnormal automaticity, refractoriness, and conduction. These characteristic changes of electrophysiologic properties culminate in loss of excitability and failure of impulse propagation and form the substrate for ventricular arrhythmias mediated through abnormal impulse formation and reentry. The ability to detail the changes in ions, metabolites, and high-energy phosphate compounds in both the extracellular and intracellular spaces and to correlate them directly with the simultaneously occurring electrophysiologic changes have greatly enhanced our understanding of the electrical events that characterize the ischemic process and hold promise for permitting studies aimed at developing interventions that may lessen the lethal consequences of ischemia.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of initiation of ventricular arrhythmias as well as those behind the complex spatiotemporal wave dynamics and its filament organization during ventricular fibrillation (VF) are the topic of intense research and debate. Mechanistic inquiry into the various mechanisms that lead to arrhythmia initiation and VF maintenance is hampered by the inability of current experimental techniques to resolve, with sufficient accuracy, electrical behavior confined to the depth of the ventricles. The objective of this article is to demonstrate that realistic 3D simulations of electrical activity in the heart are capable of bringing a new level of understanding of the mechanisms that underlie arrhythmia initiation and subsequent organization. The article does this by presenting the results of two multiscale simulation studies of ventricular electrical behavior. The first study aims to uncover the mechanisms responsible for rendering the ventricles vulnerable to electric shocks during a specific interval of time, the vulnerable window. The second study focuses on elucidating the role of electrophysiological heterogeneity, and specifically, differences in action potential duration in various ventricular structures, in VF organization. Both studies share common multiscale modeling approaches and analysis, including characterization of scroll-wave filament dynamics.},

abstract = {Many drugs fail in the clinical trials and therefore do not reach the market due to adverse effects on cardiac electrical function. This represents a growing concern for both regulatory and pharmaceutical agencies as it translates into important socio-economic costs. Drugs affecting cardiac activity come from diverse pharmacological groups and their interaction with cardiac electrophysiology can result in increased risk of potentially life threatening arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes. The mechanisms of drug interaction with the heart are very complex and the effects span from the ion channel to the whole organ level. This makes their investigation using solely experimental in vitro and in vivo techniques very difficult. Computational modelling of cardiac electrophysiological behaviour has provided insight into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmogenesis, with high spatio-temporal resolution, from the ion channel to the whole organ level. It therefore represents a powerful tool in investigating mechanisms of drug-induced changes in cardiac behaviour and in their pro-arrhythmic potential. This article presents a comprehensive review of the recent advances in detailed models of drug action on cardiac electrophysiological activity.},

abstract = {We used computer simulation to study the possible role of the dispersion of cellular coupling, refractoriness or both, in the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmias. Local ischemia was first assumed to induce cell to cell dispersion of the coupling resistance (case 1), refractory period (case 2), or both (case 3). Our numerical experiments based on the van Capelle and Durrer model showed that vortices could not be induced. On the other hand, with cellular properties dispersed in a patchy way within the ischemic zone, a single activation wave could give rise to abnormal activities. This demonstrates the stability of the wave front under small inhomogeneities. Probabilities of reentry, estimated for the three cases cited above showed that a severe alteration of the coupling resistance may be an important factor in the genesis of reentry. Moreover, use of isochronal maps revealed that vortices were both stable and sustained with an alteration of the coupling alone or along with a reduction of the action potential duration. Conversely, simulations with reduction of the refractoriness alone, inducing only transient patterns, could exhibit functionally determined reentries.},

abstract = {Cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channels underlie membrane depolarization during the upstroke of the action potential (AP). These channels also exhibit a late, slowly-inactivating component of current (late I(Na)) that may be enhanced under pathological conditions such as heart failure, and may therefore promote AP prolongation and increase the likelihood of arrhythmia. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) functionally modifies Na(+) channels, however it remains unclear if the CaMKII-dependent changes in late I(Na) are a major contributor to cellular arrhythmias such as early after depolarizations (EADs). In this study we develop a model of I(Na), including CaMKII-dependent effects, based on experimental measurements. The Na(+) channel model is incorporated into a computational model of the whole myocyte which describes excitation-contraction coupling via stochastic simulation of individual Ca(2+) release sites. Simulations suggest that relatively small augmentation of late I(Na) is sufficient to significantly prolong APs and lead to the appearance of EADs.},

abstract = {1. Reactivation kinetics of the rapid and slow inward currents in ventricular fibres have been assessed by studying the maximum rate of rise ((dV/dt)max) of the action potential upstroke and the duration of the plateau in progressively earlier premature responses. Reactivation of the slow inward current was also studied by voltage clamp technique in sheep and pig ventricular trabeculae.2. The time constant of recovery of (dV/dt)max was voltage dependent and increased from less than 20 msec when the resting membrane potential was more negative than -80 mV to more than 100 msec when the resting membrane potential was between -65 and -60 mV. Similar results were obtained in Purkinje fibres. These results suggest that the time constant for reactivation is slower than the time constant for inactivation of the rapid inward current system by at least one order of magnitude.3. The time constant of recovery of plateau duration was also voltage dependent and increased from 30 to 70 msec as the membrane potential was changed from -85 to -60 mV.4. The reactivation time constant of the slow inward current determined by voltage clamp experiments were similar to the results obtained by analysis of plateau duration. At potentials less negative than -60 mV the time constant of reactivation became progressively longer. Unlike reactivation time constants of (dV/dt)max, the time constants of reactivation of the slow inward current were similar to the time constants of inactivation.5. Our results indicate that (a) in premature action potentials, time as well as voltage are important determinants of (dV/dt)max in myocardial and Purkinje fibres, (b) the kinetics of reactivation of the rapid inward current in cardiac fibres are different from those in nerve and (c) plateau duration of premature action potentials in ventricular myocardial fibres is largely determined by the kinetics of reactivation of the slow calcium inward current.},

A robust generic cardiac ionic model employing membrane currents based on two-gate Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics is described. Its generic nature allows it to accurately reproduce action potential waveforms in heterogeneous cardiac tissue by optimizing parameters governing ion channel kinetics and magnitudes. The model allows a user-defined number of voltage and time-dependent ion currents to be incorporated, in order to reproduce and predict multiple action potential waveforms recorded in intact cardiac myocyte. In total 12 N(c)+2 parameters were optimized using a curvilinear gradient method, where N(c) is the user-specified number of time-dependent currents. Given appropriate experimental datasets, many of the known physiological membrane currents could be effectively reconstructed. Also, the optimized models were able to predict additional experimental action potential recordings that were not used in the optimization process.},

abstract = {Cell lines expressing ion channels (IC) and the advent of plate-based electrophysiology device have enabled a molecular understanding of the action potential (AP) as a means of early QT assessment. We sought to develop an in silico AP (isAP) model that provides an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte AP duration (APD) using concentration-effect curve data from a panel of five ICs (hNav1.5, hCav1.2, hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2, hKv7.1/hminK, hKv11.1). A test set of 53 compounds was selected to cover a range of selective and mixed IC modulators that were tested for their effects on optically measured APD. A threshold of >10\% change in APD at 90\% repolarization (APD(90)) was used to signify an effect at the top test concentration. To capture the variations observed in left ventricular midmyocardial myocyte APD data from 19 different dogs, the isAP model was calibrated to produce an ensemble of 19 model variants that could capture the shape and form of the APs and also quantitatively replicate dofetilide- and diltiazem-induced APD(90) changes. Provided with IC panel data only, the isAP model was then used, blinded, to predict APD(90) changes greater than 10\%. At a simulated concentration of 30 $\mu$M and based on a criterion that six of the variants had to agree, isAP prediction was scored as showing greater than 80\% predictivity of compound activity. Thus, early in drug discovery, the isAP model allows integrating separate IC data and is amenable to the throughput required for use as a virtual screen.},

abstract = {The goal of this modeling research is to provide mechanistic insight into the effect of altered membrane kinetics associated with 5-12 min of acute global ischemia on the upper limit of cardiac vulnerability (ULV) to electric shocks. We simulate electrical activity in a finite-element bidomain model of a 4-mm-thick slice through the canine ventricles that incorporates realistic geometry and fiber architecture. Global acute ischemia is represented by changes in membrane dynamics due to hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hypoxia. Two stages of acute ischemia are simulated corresponding to 5-7 min (stage 1) and 10-12 min (stage 2) after the onset of ischemia. Monophasic shocks are delivered in normoxia and ischemia over a range of coupling intervals, and their outcomes are examined to determine the highest shock strength that resulted in induction of reentrant arrhythmia. Our results demonstrate that acute ischemia stage 1 results in ULV reduction to 0.8A from its normoxic value of 1.4A. In contrast, no arrhythmia is induced regardless of shock strength in acute ischemia stage 2. An investigation of mechanisms underlying this behavior revealed that decreased postshock refractoriness resulting mainly from 1) ischemic electrophysiological substrate and 2) decrease in the extent of areas positively-polarized by the shock is responsible for the change in ULV during stage 1. In contrast, conduction failure is the main cause for the lack of vulnerability in acute ischemia stage 2. The insight provided by this study furthers our understanding of mechanisms by which acute ischemia-induced changes at the ionic level modulate cardiac vulnerability to electric shocks.},

abstract = {The aim of experiments described here was to test whether deactivation of cardiac myofibrils in acidic pH is associated with decreases in amounts of calcium bound to myofilament troponin. We determined the amounts of myofibrillar bound calcium attributable to troponin, from measurements of calcium binding to myofibrils and to myosin and from determination of the troponin C content of the myofibrillar preparations (0.40 nmol troponin C/mg protein). In measurements done at 2 mM free magnesium, 2 mM (magnesium-adenosine triphosphate, ionic strength 0.12, 22 degrees C, the pCa50 (-log of the half maximally activating molar free calcium) for myofibrillar magnesium-adenosine triphosphatase activity was 5.87 at pH 7.0, 5.49 at pH 6.5, and 5.04 at pH 6.2. This change in calcium sensitivity of myofibrillar magnesium-adenosine triphosphatase activity was present whether or not ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic acid, was used to buffer the free calcium and whether or not myofibrillar troponin I had been phosphorylated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. However, the change in pCa50 of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase activity induced by acidic pH, was greater when free magnesium was reduced from 2.0 to 0.05 mM, and less when free magnesium was increased from 2.0 mM to 10 and 15 mM. The change in pCa50 with acidic pH was less if the ionic strength was reduced from 0.12 to 0.035 M. The magnesium-adenosine triphosphatase activity of troponin/tropomyosin-free myofibrils was independent of pCa and unaffected by a reduction of pH from 7.0 to 6.5. The affinity of myofibrillar troponin C for calcium decreased as pH was reduced from 7.0 to 6.5 and to 6.2 with and without ethyleneglycolbis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, and in a manner predicted from the effect of acidic pH on pCa50 for myofibrillar activation. Our results are consistent with the idea that at least part of the mechanism responsible for deactivation of the adenosine triphosphatase activity of cardiac myofilaments in acidic pH is a reduction in the affinity of myofibrillar troponin C for calcium.},

abstract = {Abnormalities in repolarization and its rate dependence are known to be related to increased proarrhythmic risk. A number of repolarization-related electrophysiological properties are commonly used as preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk. However, the variability and complexity of repolarization mechanisms make the use of cellular biomarkers to predict arrhythmic risk preclinically challenging. Our goal is to investigate the role of ionic current properties and their variability in modulating cellular biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to improve risk stratification and identification in humans. A systematic investigation into the sensitivity of the main preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to changes in ionic current conductances and kinetics was performed using computer simulations. Four stimulation protocols were applied to the ten Tusscher and Panfilov human ventricular model to quantify the impact of +/-15 and +/-30\% variations in key model parameters on action potential (AP) properties, Ca(2+) and Na(+) dynamics, and their rate dependence. Simulations show that, in humans, AP duration is moderately sensitive to changes in all repolarization current conductances and in L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and slow component of the delayed rectifier current (I(Ks)) inactivation kinetics. AP triangulation, however, is strongly dependent only on inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) and delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) conductances. Furthermore, AP rate dependence (i.e., AP duration rate adaptation and restitution properties) and intracellular Ca(2+) and Na(+) levels are highly sensitive to both I(CaL) and Na(+)/K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) properties. This study provides quantitative insights into the sensitivity of preclinical biomarkers of arrhythmic risk to variations in ionic current properties in humans. The results show the importance of sensitivity analysis as a powerful method for the in-depth validation of mathematical models in cardiac electrophysiology.},

abstract = {Rationale: Genetic testing for Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is now a standard and integral component of clinical cardiology. A major obstacle to the interpretation of genetic findings is the lack of robust functional assays to determine the pathogenicity of identified gene variants in a high throughput manner. Objective: The goal of this study was to design and test a high throughput in vivo cardiac assay to distinguish between disease-causing and benign KCNH2 (hERG1) variants, using the zebrafish as a model organism. Methods and Results: We tested the ability of previously characterized LQTS hERG1 mutations and polymorphisms to restore normal repolarization in the kcnh2-knockdown embryonic zebrafish. The cardiac assay correctly identified a benign variant in 9 of 10 cases (negative predictive value 90\%) while correctly identifying a disease-causing variant in 39/39 cases (positive predictive value 100\%). Conclusions: The in vivo zebrafish cardiac assay approaches the accuracy of the current benchmark in vitro assay for the detection of disease-causing mutations and is far superior in terms of throughput rate. Together with emerging algorithms for interpreting a positive LQTS genetic test, the zebrafish cardiac assay provides an additional tool for the final determination of pathogenicity of gene variants identified in LQTS genetic screening.},

abstract = {Effective reuse of a quantitative mathematical model requires not just access to curated versions of the model equations, but also an understanding of the functional capabilities of the model, and the advisable scope of its application. To enable this "functional curation" we have developed a simulation environment that provides high-throughput evaluation of a mathematical model's functional response to an arbitrary user-defined protocol, and optionally compares the results against experimental data. In this study we demonstrate the efficacy of this simulation environment on 31 cardiac electrophysiology cell models using two test cases. The S1-S2 response is evaluated to characterise the models' restitution curves, and their L-type calcium channel current-voltage curves are evaluated. The significant variation in the response of these models, even when the models represent the same species and temperature, demonstrates the importance of knowing the functional characteristics of a model prior to its reuse. We also discuss the wider implications for this approach, in improving the selection of models for reuse, enabling the identification of models that exhibit particular experimentally observed phenomena, and making the incremental development of models more robust.},

@phdthesis{Sher2007,
abstract = {In a single cardiac muscle cell (myocyte), the excitation–contraction coupling is regulated by calcium (Ca2+) dynamics. These are characterized by tightly controlled Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Non–spontaneous SR Ca2+ release is triggered by elevated Ca2+ entering via L–Type Ca2+ Channels (LCCs) and is known as Ca2+– induced Ca2+ release (CICR), while spontaneous opening of RyRs is known as spontaneous Ca2+ spark. The sodium–calcium exchanger (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or NCX), which is the main pathway for Ca2+ extrusion from ventricular myocytes, plays an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis. Both the role of the Ca2+ entry mode of NCX in regulating local Ca2+ dynamics and the role of the Ca2+ exit mode during the majority of the physiological action potential (AP) are subjects of controversy. We incorporated local NCX current into biophysically detailed models of Ca2+ dynamics both for spontaneous and non–spontaneous SR Ca2+ release. Using the newly–developed CICR mod- els, which describe the stochastic interaction of LCCs and RyRs and allow the incorporation of NCX within dyads either in a uniform or nonuniform fashion, we examined the functional sig- nificance of NCX location in T–tubules and potential co–localization with RyR. Our simulations demonstrated that under physiological conditions local Ca2+ gradients are critical in calculating the driving force for NCX and hence in predicting the effect of NCX on the AP. We showed that under physiological conditions the INCX current may have three reversal points (rather than the conventionally assumed one) during an AP which suggests a great flexibility of INCX for dynam- ical regulation during an AP. The more complex (than previously believed) dynamic regulation of INCX during an AP under physiological conditions allows us to interpret apparently contradic- tory experimental data in a consistent conceptual framework. Furthermore, under physiological conditions our modelling predicted that (i) during Ca2+–induced Ca2+ release the co–localization of NCX with RyR increases the magnitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transients insignificantly and (ii) during spontaneous SR Ca2+ release the block of the NCX currents results in an increase in the Ca2+ spark frequency. Under pathological conditions, however, we found that NCX may act as a trigger or enhancer. Specifically, our simulations demonstrated that NCX co–localization with RyR is critical for maintaining efficient EC coupling in the case of altered LCC dynamics. Our results concerning the role of NCX in spontaneous SR release further supported the claim that NCX regulates the local control of Ca2+ in the dyadic space. Finally, we incorporated the biophysically detailed local Ca2+ dynamics into the Noble 1998 single cell ventricular model in the place of the existing phenomenological calcium dynamics. To tune the parameters in an efficient computational manner, the distributive computing Nimrod/O software was used. Our modelling results suggest both (i) new explanations and insights into the role of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers as well as (ii) new experiments to be performed, and provide a powerful tool for further investigations into the control of SR Ca2+ release.},

abstract = {Mechano-electrical feedback was studied in the single ventricular myocytes. A small fraction (approximately 10\%) of the cell surface could be stretched or compressed by a glass stylus. Stretch depolarised, shortened the action potential and induced extra systoles. Stretch activated non-selective cation currents (Ins) showed a linear voltage dependence, a reversal potential of 0mV, a pure cation selectivity, and were blocked by 8 mMGd3+ or 30 mM streptomycin. Stretch reduced Ca2+ and K+ (IK) currents. Local compression of broadwise attached cells activated IK but not Ins: Cytochalasin Dor colchicin, thought to disrupt the cytoskeleton, suppressed the mechanosensitivity of Ins and IK: During stretch, the cytosolic sodium concentration increased with spatial heterogeneities, local hotspots with [Na+]c>24mM appeared close to surface membrane and t-tubules (pseudoratiometric imaging using Sodium Green fluorescence). Electronprobe microanalysis confirmed this result and indicated that stretch increased total sodium [Na] in cell compartments such as mitochondria, nuclear envelope and nucleus. Our results obtained by local stretch differ from those obtained by end-to-end stretch (literature).We speculate that channels may be activated not only by axial but also by shear stress, and, that stretch can activate channels outside the deformed sarcomeres via second messenger.},

Isolated perfused hearts were studied using indo-1 fluorescence ratio as an index of [Ca2+]c.tau P was used as an index of myocardial relaxation. The time constant of decline of the indo-1 ratio increased from 74 +/- 5 ms to 95 +/- 4, 144 +/- 10, and to 204 +/- 16 ms when coronary flow was reduced was reduced to 50, 20, and 10\% of control, respectively. Indo-1 transients were calibrated to calculate tau Ca. tau Ca increased from 67 +/- 6 ms to 108 +/- 9 and 158 +/- 19 ms when coronary flow was reduced to 20 and 10\% of control, respectively. There was a linear relationship between tau Ca and tau P (r = 0.82). These data support the hypothesis that during low flow ischemia, impaired myocardial relaxation may be caused by slowing of [Ca2+]c decline.},

abstract = {Despite many years of research, the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) are still poorly understood, and we currently are unable to adequately treat most patients with AF. Recently, the demonstration in both human and animal studies that the pulmonary veins (PVs) and the posterior left atrial (LA) wall play a substantial role in triggering and in driving the fibrillatory activity has opened new avenues for research into the mechanisms of initiation and maintenance AF at many levels of integration. This article focuses on recent studies at the whole-heart level that support the hypothesis that maintenance of AF, whether paroxysmal or persistent, may depend on the periodic activity of a small number of rotors in the posterior LA wall-PV region. These rotors activate the atria at exceedingly high frequencies and result in fibrillatory conduction. Recent clinical studies involving either segmental PV isolation or circumferential PV ablation support this view. Such encouraging results suggest that collaboration between basic and clinical electrophysiologists will lead to a more precise understanding of the manner in which rotors stabilize in the PV-LA junction, which should open new doors for the development of innovative approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanisms underlying the initiation of ventricular arrhythmias in ischemia by a premature beat or after a pause remain unclear. The kinetics of electrical restitution, which is the modulation of action potential duration (APD) by an abrupt alteration in cycle length, may be important. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recorded one or two simultaneous monophasic action potentials (MAPs) from the right ventricular septum during balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (14 patients), which is expected to induce ischemia at the recording site, and during occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) (7 patients), which is not expected to induce ischemia at the recording area. The latter acted as a control. A test pulse sequence was incorporated whereby during steady-state pacing, test beats of altered cycle length were interpose. During LAD occlusion, APD for basic beats shortened from 260 +/- 4 to 236 +/- 4 ms (P < .0001), whereas the control group (RCA occlusion) showed no significant change (251 +/- 7 to 249 +/- 9 ms; P = NS). LAD occlusion resulted in flattening of the slope relating APD of test beats to diastolic interval (P = .001), whereas in the control group (RCA occlusion) the slope remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained during a second occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: LAD occlusion in patients during balloon angioplasty shortened MAP duration of basic beats and minimized, abolished, or reversed the normal APD/diastolic-interval relation of test beats of altered cycle length at sites served by the occluded vessel. The results suggest that ischemia flattens the electrical restitution curve in the human endocardium. These findings may have important implications in arrhythmogenesis.},

abstract = {T-wave alternans may predict the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and experimental work has linked discordant repolarization alternans to the induction of re-entry. The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of transmural repolarization alternans and to investigate the link between alternans and ventricular arrhythmia in rabbits with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Optical mapping was used to record action potentials from the transmural surface of left ventricular wedge preparations from normal and post-infarction hearts during a progressive reduction in pacing cycle length at 30 and 37°C. Data were analyzed using custom software, including spectral analysis. There were no significant differences in baseline transmural electrophysiology between the groups. Post-infarction hearts had a lower threshold for both repolarization alternans (286 vs. 333 bpm, p<0.05) and ventricular arrhythmias (79 vs. 19\%, p<0.01) during rapid pacing, which was not accounted for by increased transmural discordant alternans. In VF-prone hearts, alternans in optical action potential amplitude was observed and increased until 2:1 block occurred. The degree of optical action potential amplitude alternans (12.0 ± 7.0 vs. 1.8 ± 0.3, p<0.05), but not APD(90) alternans (1.4 ± 0.6 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1, p>0.05) was associated with VF inducibility during rapid pacing. Post-infarction hearts are more vulnerable to transmural alternans and ventricular arrhythmias at rapid rates. Alternans in optical action potential amplitude was associated with conduction block and VF. The data suggest that changes in optical action potential amplitude may underlie a mechanism for alternans-associated ventricular arrhythmia in left ventricular dysfunction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia in the settings of chronic myocardial infarction (MI) is an important clinical problem. Arrhythmic risk post-MI continues indefinitely even if heart failure and acute ischemia are not present due to the anatomic substrate of the scar and border zone (BZ) tissue. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine mechanisms of arrhythmia initiation and termination in a rabbit model of chronic MI. METHODS: Ligation of the lateral division of the left circumflex artery was performed 72 +/- 29 days before acute experiments (n = 11). Flecainide (2.13 +/- 0.64 microM) was administered to promote sustained arrhythmias, which were induced with burst pacing or a multiple shock protocol (four pulses, 140-200 ms coupling interval). RESULTS: Panoramic optical mapping with blebbistatin (5 microM) revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) maintained by a single mother rotor (cycle length [CL] = 174.7 +/- 38.4 ms) as the primary mechanism of arrhythmia. Mother rotors were anchored to the scar or BZ for 16 of the 19 rotor locations recorded. Cardioversion thresholds (CVTs) were determined at various phases throughout the VT CL from external shock electrodes. CVTs were found to be phase dependent, and the maximum versus minimum CVT was 7.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.6 V/cm, respectively (P = .005). Antitachycardia pacing was found to be effective in only 2.7\% of cases in this model. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that scar and BZ tissue heterogeneity provide the substrate for VT by attracting and stabilizing rotors. Additionally, a significant reduction in CVT may be achieved by appropriately timed shocks in which the shock-induced virtual electrode polarization interacts with the rotor to destabilize VT.},

In this paper we augment existing systems with a small set of special “actors” that implement the parameter estimation logic. Specifically, we discuss a set of new Kepler actors that support both complete and partial sweeps based on experimental design techniques. When combined with a novel parallel execution mechanism, we are able to execute parallel sweeps and searches across workflows that run on distributed “Grid” infrastruc- ture. We illustrate our new system with a case study in cardiac cell modelling.},

abstract = {Certain signaling events that promote L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC) phosphorylation, such as beta-adrenergic stimulation or an increased expression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, promote mode 2 gating of LCCs. Experimental data suggest the hypothesis that these events increase the likelihood of early after-depolarizations (EADs). We test this hypothesis using an ionic model of the canine ventricular myocyte incorporating stochastic gating of LCCs and ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channels. The model is extended to describe myocyte responses to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Results demonstrate that in the presence of isoproterenol the random opening of a small number of LCCs gating in mode 2 during the plateau phase of the action potential (AP) can trigger EADs. EADs occur randomly, where the likelihood of these events increases as a function of the fraction of LCCs gating in mode 2. Fluctuations of the L-type Ca2+ current during the AP plateau lead to variability in AP duration. Consequently, prolonged APs are occasionally observed and exhibit an increased likelihood of EAD formation. These results suggest a novel stochastic mechanism, whereby phosphorylation-induced changes in LCC gating properties contribute to EAD generation.},

abstract = {Computational modeling has traditionally played an important role in dissecting the mechanisms for cardiac dysfunction. Ventricular electromechanical models, likely the most sophisticated virtual organs to date, integrate detailed information across the spatial scales of cardiac electrophysiology and mechanics and are capable of capturing the emergent behavior and the interaction between electrical activation and mechanical contraction of the heart. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the latest advancements in multiscale electromechanical modeling of the ventricles. We first detail the general framework of multiscale ventricular electromechanical modeling and describe the state of the art in computational techniques and experimental validation approaches. The powerful utility of ventricular electromechanical models in providing a better understanding of cardiac function is then demonstrated by reviewing the latest insights obtained by these models, focusing primarily on the mechanisms by which mechanoelectric coupling contributes to ventricular arrythmogenesis, the relationship between electrical activation and mechanical contraction in the normal heart, and the mechanisms of mechanical dyssynchrony and resynchronization in the failing heart. Computational modeling of cardiac electromechanics will continue to complement basic science research and clinical cardiology and holds promise to become an important clinical tool aiding the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease.},

@article{Volders1999,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ventricular action potential exhibits regional heterogeneity in configuration and duration (APD). Across the left ventricular (LV) free wall, this is explained by differences in repolarizing K+ currents. However, the ionic basis of electrical nonuniformity in the right ventricle (RV) versus the LV is poorly investigated. We examined transient outward (ITO1), delayed (IKs and IKr), and inward rectifier K+ currents (IK1) in relation to action potential characteristics of RV and LV midmyocardial (M) cells of the same adult canine hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single RV and LV M cells were used for microelectrode recordings and whole-cell voltage clamping. Action potentials showed deeper notches, shorter APDs at 50\% and 95\% of repolarization, and less prolongation on slowing of the pacing rate in RV than LV. ITO1 density was significantly larger in RV than LV, whereas steady-state inactivation and rate of recovery were similar. IKs tail currents, measured at -25 mV and insensitive to almokalant (2 micromol/L), were considerably larger in RV than LV. IKr, measured as almokalant-sensitive tail currents at -50 mV, and IK1 were not different in the 2 ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in K+ currents may well explain the interventricular heterogeneity of action potentials in M layers of the canine heart. These results contribute to a further phenotyping of the ventricular action potential under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {The clustering of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) into functional Ca2+ release units is central to current models for cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Using immunolabeling and confocal microscopy, we have analyzed the distribution of RyR2 clusters in rat and ventricular atrial myocytes. The resolution of the three-dimensional structure was improved by a novel transverse sectioning method as well as digital deconvolution. In contrast to earlier reports, the mean RyR2 cluster transverse spacing was measured 1.05 microm in ventricular myocytes and estimated 0.97 microm in atrial myocytes. Intercalated RyR2 clusters were found interspersed between the Z-disks on the cell periphery but absent in the interior, forming double rows flanking the local Z-disks on the surface. The longitudinal spacing between the adjacent rows of RyR2 clusters on the Z-disks was measured to have a mean value of 1.87 microm in ventricular and 1.69 microm in atrial myocytes. The measured RyR2 cluster distribution is compatible with models of Ca2+ wave generation. The size of the typical RyR2 cluster was close to 250 nm, and this suggests that approximately 100 RyR2s might be present in a cluster. The importance of cluster size and three-dimensional spacing for current E-C coupling models is discussed.},

"Backflux" through the SR calcium pump is a critical feature which allows realistically small values for SR calcium leak fluxes to be used. Total cytosolic calcium was calculated from the latter part of [Ca](i) decline using rate constants for cellular calcium buffers. Intra-SR calcium buffering characteristics were also deduced. We found that the net SR calcium pump flux and rate of [Ca](i) decline decreased as the SR free [Ca] rose, with pump parameters held constant. We have therefore characterized for the first time in intact myocytes both forward and reverse SR calcium pump kinetics as well as intra-SR calcium buffering and SR calcium leak. We conclude that the reverse flux through the SR calcium pump is an important factor in comprehensive understanding of dynamic SR calcium fluxes.},

abstract = {Properties of the delayed outward current (IK) in ventricular myocytes of the guinea-pig were studied using the whole cell clamp method. The experiments were performed under conditions in which IK was enhanced by application of isoproterenol while the Ca2+ current was eliminated by Ca2+-removal and by the addition of Cd2+. The reversal potential (Erev) of IK, determined from the current tails, was about 10 mV less negative than the K+ equilibrium potential. This was estimated by examining the reversal potential of the inward rectifier K+ current in Ba2+-containing solution, or from the Nernst equation. The Erev--log[K+]o relationship had a slope of 49 mV per tenfold change in [K+]o. In Na+-free solution, Erev became more negative. Thus, although the major charge carriers in IK are K+ ions, Na+ ions may also contribute in part to this current. The PNa/PK ratio in IK, calculated by applying a Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relation to the reversal potential, was 0.016. The activation of IK during depolarization showed a sigmoidal time course at the onset, while the time course of the current tails was monoexponential at voltages more negative than-50 mV, but biexponential at more positive voltages. These observations can be explained by the conductance equation of the Hodgkin-Huxley type in which the kinetic variable is raised to the second power. These and other features of IK observed in the ventricular cells are discussed in comparison to the properties of similar current systems reported in other cardiac preparations.},

abstract = {Cardiac ischemia causes beat-to-beat fluctuation in action potential duration (APD) alternans, which leads to T wave alternans and arrhythmias. Occurrence of APD alternans that is out of phase at two sites is especially important, but most APD alternans studies have involved rapid pacing of normal myocardium rather than ischemia. To determine the spatial features of APD alternans during ischemia, blood-perfused rabbit hearts were stained with 4-[beta-[2(di-n-butylamino)-6-napthyl]vinyl]pyridinium (di-4-ANEPPS) and imaged with a high-resolution camera. Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Tyrode solution at 37 degrees C for staining and then switched to a 50:50\% blood/Tyrode mixture. Hearts were paced from the right ventricle at 3/s, and made ischemic by stopping flow for 6 min. Images of 10,000 pixels were obtained at 300 frames/s. Motion artifact was controlled by immobilization and by manual selection of undistorted single-pixel records. Upstroke propagation and conduction isochrones were displayed by computerized image processing. APD alternans was demonstrated in six of seven hearts, and was out of phase in different regions of the image in three hearts. The largest spatial variation in the onset of depolarization to 50\% repolarization (APD50) was 155\%. This caused beat-to-beat reversal of repolarization. An alternans map could be constructed for well-immobilized portions of the image. There were discrete regions of APD alternans separated by a boundary, as occurs with intracellular Ca2+ concentration alternans. Pixels as close together as 1.1 mm showed an APD alternans that was out of phase. The out-of-phase APD alternans was not due to conduction alternans, as shown by upstroke intervals and conduction isochrones. This contrasts with rapid pacing, where a causal relationship appears to exist. These new observations suggest distinct mechanisms for the genesis of arrhythmias during ischemia.},

abstract = {The drug-induced long QT syndrome is a distinct clinical entity that has evolved from an electrophysiologic curiosity to a centerpiece in drug regulation and development. This evolution reflects an increasing recognition that a rare adverse drug effect can profoundly upset the balance between benefit and risk that goes into the prescription of a drug by an individual practitioner as well as the approval of a new drug entity by a regulatory agency. This review will outline how defining the central mechanism, block of the cardiac delayed-rectifier potassium current I(Kr), has contributed to defining risk in patients and in populations. Models for studying risk, and understanding the way in which clinical risk factors modulate cardiac repolarization at the molecular level are discussed. Finally, the role of genetic variants in modulating risk is described.},

@article{Hondeghem2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prolongation of the plateau of the action potential duration, in the absence of instability and triangulation, can reverse the proarrhythmia elicited by a class III antiarrhythmic agent. METHODS: The effects of almokalant, erythromycin and their combination, on cardiac electrophysiological parameters (action potential duration (APD), instability, triangulation and ectopics) were evaluated in isolated hearts from female albino rabbits. In this study, proarrhythmia was estimated quantitatively by number of ectopic beats. RESULTS: Erythromycin lengthened the APD primarily by a prolongation of the plateau, while having only minor effects upon phase 3 repolarization. The prolongation did not induce much instability, triangulation or reverse use dependence and, as expected, erythromycin did not induce significant proarrhythmia. Almokalant also lengthened APD, but it did not lengthen the plateau; instead, it prolonged phase 3 repolarization. The prolongation markedly triangulated the action potential, elicited much instability and marked reverse use dependence. This combination of effects induced very marked proarrhythmia. When almokalant and erythromycin were combined, their effects upon APD appeared additive: both the plateau and the repolarization phase were prolonged. However, the larger prolongation of APD did not lead to more proarrhythmia; this suggests that a prolongation of APD is not proarrhythmic per se. On the contrary, proarrhythmia as a function of APD prolongation was reduced in the presence of erythromycin (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Instability plus triangulation consistently lead to serious proarrhythmia especially when combined with reverse use dependence, but prolongation of APD in itself is not necessarily proarrhythmic. In fact, APD prolongation in the absence of instability and triangulation can be antiarrhythmic.},

Experimental work shows that these properties vary considerably across identified neurons in different animals. Given this variability in experimental data, this review describes some of the complications of building computational models to aid in understanding how system dynamics arise from the interaction of system components. We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function.},

abstract = {The various cardiac regions have specific action potential properties appropriate to their electrical specialization, resulting from a specific pattern of ion-channel functional expression. The present study addressed regionally defined differential ion-channel expression in the non-diseased human heart with a genomic approach. High-throughput real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression patterns of 79 ion-channel subunit transcripts and related genes in atria, ventricular epicardium and endocardium, and Purkinje fibres isolated from 15 non-diseased human donor hearts. Two-way non-directed hierarchical clustering separated atria, Purkinje fibre and ventricular compartments, but did not show specific patterns for epicardium versus endocardium, nor left- versus right-sided chambers. Genes that characterized the atria (versus ventricles) included Cx40, Kv1.5 and Kir3.1 as expected, but also Cav1.3, Cav3.1, Cav alpha2 delta2, Nav beta1, TWIK1, TASK1 and HCN4. Only Kir2.1, RyR2, phospholamban and Kv1.4 showed higher expression in the ventricles. The Purkinje fibre expression-portrait (versus ventricle) included stronger expression of Cx40, Kv4.3, Kir3.1, TWIK1, HCN4, ClC6 and CALM1, along with weaker expression of mRNA encoding Cx43, Kir2.1, KChIP2, the pumps/exchangers Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, NCX1, SERCA2, and the Ca(2+)-handling proteins RYR2 and CASQ2. Transcripts that were more strongly expressed in epicardium (versus endocardium) included Cav1.2, KChIP2, SERCA2, CALM3 and calcineurin-alpha. Nav1.5 and Nav beta1 were more strongly expressed in the endocardium. For selected genes, RT-PCR data were confirmed at the protein level. This is the first report of the global portrait of regional ion-channel subunit-gene expression in the non-diseased human heart. Our data point to significant regionally determined ion-channel expression differences, with potentially important implications for understanding regional electrophysiology, arrhythmia mechanisms, and responses to ion-channel blocking drugs. Concordance with previous functional studies suggests that regional regulation of cardiac ion-current expression may be primarily transcriptional.},

Major transitions in these fields were driven by the appearance of the Aiba, Humphrey, and Millis text, Fredrickson's guidance on conceptualizing mathematical representations of cell populations, and Ramkrishna's development of the cybernetic modeling approach. The value of mathematical models to organize data, to consider interactions in complex systems in a rational way, to correct the conventional wisdom, and to understand essential qualitative features of biological systems has been clearly documented in prior research. The impact of this research in biotechnology discovery has so far been limited, but this will change in the future if we are adept in recognizing emerging opportunities and in integrating new concepts and tools into our research. Mathematical structures and methods, allied with extraordinary contemporary computing power, are essential to the emerging field of functional genomics. Important in this quest is a hierarchy of powerful modeling, analysis, and computational tools which can capture essential quantitative features of available experimental data and use these effectively for analysis and design of metabolism.},

During ischemia [K+]o reproducibly increased at rates of 0.5-1 mM/min, usually in a triphasic pattern, and was accompanied by shortening of the action potential duration (APD) and an increase in conduction time (CT). Hyperkalemia, equivalent to that occurring during ischemia, in combination with respiratory acidosis (pH 6.2-6.5) and catecholamines reproduced quantitatively the ischemia-induced changes in APD and CT. None of these factors alone produced quantitatively comparable electrophysiological changes. Faster heart rates increased [K+]o accumulation during ischemia and accentuated the changes in APD and CT during ischemia. These findings suggest that local hyperkalemia, intracellular acidosis, and catecholamines release during early ischemia may account for electrophysiological changes predisposing to the development of reentrant arrhythmias.},

(i) Parameter unidentifiability (found in 9 out of 13 of the considered models) results in an inability to determine the correct layout of a model, contradicting the idea that model structure and parameters provide insights into underlying molecular processes. (ii) The information content of experimental voltage step clamp data is discussed, and a short but sufficient protocol for parameter estimation is presented. (iii) MMs have been associated with high computational cost (owing to their large number of state variables), presenting an obstacle for multicellular whole organ simulations as well as parameter estimation. It is shown that the stiffness of models increases computation time more than the number of states. (iv) Algorithms and software programs are provided for steady-state analysis, analytical solutions for voltage steps and numerical derivation of parameter identifiability. The results provide a new standard for ion channel modelling to further the automation of model development, the validation process and the predictive power of these models.},

abstract = {The sodium-potassium pump is widely recognized as the principal mechanism for active ion transport across the cellular membrane of cardiac tissue, being responsible for the creation and maintenance of the transarcolemmal sodium and potassium gradients, crucial for cardiac cell electrophysiology. Importantly, sodium-potassium pump activity is impaired in a number of major diseased conditions, including ischemia and heart failure. However, its subtle ways of action on cardiac electrophysiology, both directly through its electrogenic nature and indirectly via the regulation of cell homeostasis, make it hard to predict the electrophysiological consequences of reduced sodium-potassium pump activity in cardiac repolarization. In this review, we discuss how recent studies adopting the systems biology approach, through the integration of experimental and modeling methodologies, have identified the sodium-potassium pump as one of the most important ionic mechanisms in regulating key properties of cardiac repolarization and its rate dependence, from subcellular to whole organ levels. These include the role of the pump in the biphasic modulation of cellular repolarization and refractoriness, the rate control of intracellular sodium and calcium dynamics and therefore of the adaptation of repolarization to changes in heart rate, as well as its importance in regulating pro-arrhythmic substrates through modulation of dispersion of repolarization and restitution. Theoretical findings are consistent across a variety of cell types and species including human, and widely in agreement with experimental findings. The novel insights and hypotheses on the role of the pump in cardiac electrophysiology obtained through this integrative approach could eventually lead to novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.},

abstract = {Moderation of calcium perturbations has been implicated in ischemic preconditioning. As mitochondria possess an effective Ca(2+)transporting system driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential, experiments were performed to study time-averaged intracellular free calcium and the mitochondrial membrane potential during preconditioning and ischemia-reperfusion. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 5 min of preconditioning, a 9-min intervening reperfusion and 21 min of ischemia with subsequent reperfusion. The hearts were preloaded with the Ca(2+)indicator Fura-2 or the mitochondrial membrane potential probe safranine. A method was devised for correction for NADH autofluorescence in time-averaged Ca(2+)probing with Fura-2. The pH dependence of the apparent dissociation constant of the Ca(2+)complex of Fura-2 was determined. Intracellular free Ca(2+)increased during the 5-min ischemia, and this was reversed upon reperfusion. During protracted ischemia a continual Ca(2+)rise was observed when the fluorescence data were corrected for changes in pH. An initial sharp Fura-2 fluorescence spike upon final reperfusion was caused by a pH-dependent change in the dissociation constant of the Ca(2+)complex of Fura-2. In preconditioned hearts the free Ca(2+)was somewhat lower during reperfusion, but a major effect of preconditioning was observed during the prolonged ischemia. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential during prolonged ischemia was faster in the preconditioned heart with no difference during the final reperfusion. The effect of preconditioning on cell survival was reflected in a decrease in the post-ischemic washout of creatine kinase. The moderation of the ischemic and post-ischemic intracellular Ca(2+)increase, and the acceleration of the ischemic mitochondrial membrane potential decrease by ischemic preconditioning is in accord with the notion of the involvement of mitochondrial ATP sensitive K(+)channels in preconditioning. In studies on ischemia it is absolutely necessary to correct for the pH-sensitivity of the apparent dissociation constant of the calcium complex of Fura-2 to obtain reliable data for intracellular free calcium.},

abstract = {Understanding of the considerable variation in action potential (AP) shape throughout the heart is necessary to explain normal and pathological cardiac function. Existing mathematical models reproduce typical APs, but not all measured APs, as fitting the sets of non-linear equations is a tedious process. The study describes the integration of a pre-existing mathematical model of an atrial cell AP with a genetic algorithm to provide an automated tool to generate APs for arbitrary cells by fitting ionic channel conductances. Using the Nygren model as the base, the technique was first verified by starting with random values and fitting the Nygren model to itself with an error of only 0.03\%. The Courtemanche model, which has a different morphology from that of the Nygren model, was successfully fitted. The AP duration restitution curve generated by the fit matched that of the target model very well. Finally, experimentally recorded APs were reproduced. To match AP duration restitution behaviour properly, it was necessary simultaneously to fit over several stimulation frequencies. Also, fitting of the upstroke was better if the stimulating current pulse replicated that found in situ as opposed to a rectangular pulse. In conclusion, the modelled parameters were successfully able to reproduce any given atrial AP. This tool can be useful for determining parameters in new AP models, reproducing specific APs, as well as determining the locus of drug action by examining changes in conductance values.},

abstract = {We sought to determine whether extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+e) and K+ (K+e) play essential roles in the normal functioning of cardiac K+ channels. Reports by others have shown that removal of Ca2+e and K+e alters the gating properties of neural delayed rectifier (IK) and A-type K+ currents, resulting in a loss of normal cation selectivity and voltage-dependent gating. We found that removal of Ca2+e and K+e from the solution bathing guinea pig ventricular myocytes often induced a leak conductance, but did not affect the ionic selectivity or time-dependent activation and deactivation properties of IK. The effect of [K+]e on the magnitude of the two components of cardiac IK was also examined. IK in guinea pig myocytes is comprised of two distinct types of currents: IKr (rapidly activating, rectifying) and IKs (slowly activating). The differential effect of Ca2+e on the two components of IK (previously shown to shift the voltage dependence of activation of the two currents in opposite directions) was exploited to determine the role of K+e on the magnitude of IKs and IKr. Lowering [K+]e from 4 to 0 mM increased IKs, as expected from the change in driving force for K+, but decreased IKr. The differential effect of [K+]e on the two components of cardiac IK may explain the reported discrepancies regarding modulation of cardiac IK conductance by this cation.},

Furthermore, models can make use of several different data sets, not always derived for the same conditions or even the same species. It is consequently uncertain whether the parameter set for a given model is physiologically accurate. Furthermore, it is only recently that the possibility of degeneracy in parameter values in producing a given simulation output has started to be addressed. In this study, we examine the effects of varying two parameters (the L-type calcium current (I(CaL)) and the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks))) in a computational model of a rabbit ventricular cardiomyocyte AP on both the membrane potential (V(m)) and calcium (Ca(2+)) transient. It will subsequently be determined if there is degeneracy in this model to these parameter values, which will have important implications on the stability of these models to cell-to-cell parameter variation, and also whether the current methodology for generating parameter values is flawed. The accuracy of AP duration (APD) as an indicator of AP shape will also be assessed.},

abstract = {Cardiac electrophysiology is a mature discipline, with the first model of a cardiac cell action potential having been developed in 1962. Current models range from single ion channels, through very complex models of individual cardiac cells, to geometrically and anatomically detailed models of the electrical activity in whole ventricles. A critical issue for model developers is how to choose parameters that allow the model to faithfully reproduce observed physiological effects without over-fitting. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parametric modelling toolkit, called Nimrod, that makes it possible both to explore model behaviour as parameters are changed and also to tune parameters by optimizing model output. Importantly, Nimrod leverages computers on the Grid, accelerating experiments by using available high-performance platforms. We illustrate the use of Nimrod with two case studies, one at the cardiac tissue level and one at the cellular level.},

abstract = {Since their discovery in pancreatic beta-cells, ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the cell membrane have been thought to mediate glucose-induced beta-cell depolarization, which is required for triggering the voltage-dependent Ca2+ uptake subserving insulin release. The theory is that metabolism of glucose (and other fuel molecules) increases intracellular ATP or possibly other metabolites that diffuse to the membrane and inhibit the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. This slows the efflux of positively charged K+ and depolarizes the cell. A recurrent source of confusion regarding this idea stems from the early observation that these channels are so exquisitely sensitive to intracellular ATP that channel opening is predicted to be approximately 99\% inhibited under physiological conditions. To account for this apparent discrepancy, various mechanisms have been proposed that might render the channels less sensitive to intracellular ATP. We use a simple mathematical model to demonstrate that there is no major discrepancy and that, in fact, given the electrophysiological mechanisms existing in the beta-cell, the extreme sensitivity of the channels to ATP is appropriate and even mandatory for their physiological function.},

abstract = {Previous work with model systems for action poten- tial conduction have been restricted to conduction between two real cells or conduction between a model cell and a real cell. The inclusion of additional elements to make a linear strand has allowed us to investigate the interactions between cells at a higher level of complexity. When, in the simplest case of a linear strand of three elements, the conductance between elements 2 and 3 (GC2) is varied, this affects the success or failure of propagation between elements 1 and 2 (coupled by GC1) as well as the success or failure of propaga- tion between elements 2 and 3. Several major features were illustrated. 1) When GC1 was only slightly greater than the coupling conductance required for successful propagation between a model cell and a real cell, addition of a third element of the strand either prevented conduction from element 1 to element 2 (when GC2 was high) or allowed conduction from element 1 to element 2 but not conduction from element 2 to element 3 (whenGC2 was low). 2) For higher levels ofGC1, there was an allowable ‘‘window’’ of values ofGC2 for successful conduction from element 1 through to element 3. The size of this allowable window of GC2 values increased with increasing values ofGC1, and this increase was produced by increases in the upper bound of GC2 values. 3) When the size of the central element of the strand was reduced, this facilitated conduction through the strand, increasing the range of the allowable window of GC2 values. The overall success or failure of conduction through a structure of cells that has a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of coupling conductances cannot be predicted simply by the average or the minimum value of coupling conductance but may depend on the actual spatial distribution of these conductances.},

abstract = {Predictions of different classes of gating models involving identical conformational changes in each of four subunits were compared to the gating behavior of Shaker potassium channels without N-type inactivation. Each model was tested to see if it could simulate the voltage dependence of the steady state open probability, and the kinetics of the single-channel currents, macroscopic ionic currents and macroscopic gating currents using a single set of parameters. Activation schemes based upon four identical single-step activation processes were found to be incompatible with the experimental results, as were those involving a concerted, opening transition. A model where the opening of the channel requires two conformational changes in each of the four subunits can adequately account for the steady state and kinetic behavior of the channel. In this model, the gating in each subunit is independent except for a stabilization of the open state when all four subunits are activated, and an unstable closed conformation that the channel enters after opening. A small amount of negative cooperativity between the subunits must be added to account quantitatively for the dependence of the activation time course on holding voltage.},

abstract = {Computational models of cardiac myocytes are important tools for understanding ionic mechanisms of arrhythmia. This work presents a new model of the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)), the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)), the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK). Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia). Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic targets.},

@article{Vavoulis2012,
abstract = {Traditional approaches to the problem of parameter estimation in biophysical models of neurons and neural networks usually adopt a global search algorithm (for example, an evolutionary algorithm), often in combination with a local search method (such as gradient descent) in order to minimize the value of a cost function, which measures the discrepancy between various features of the available experimental data and model output. In this study, we approach the problem of parameter estimation in conductance-based models of single neurons from a different perspective. By adopting a hidden-dynamical-systems formalism, we expressed parameter estimation as an inference problem in these systems, which can then be tackled using a range of well-established statistical inference methods. The particular method we used was Kitagawa's self-organizing state-space model, which was applied on a number of Hodgkin-Huxley-type models using simulated or actual electrophysiological data. We showed that the algorithm can be used to estimate a large number of parameters, including maximal conductances, reversal potentials, kinetics of ionic currents, measurement and intrinsic noise, based on low-dimensional experimental data and sufficiently informative priors in the form of pre-defined constraints imposed on model parameters. The algorithm remained operational even when very noisy experimental data were used. Importantly, by combining the self-organizing state-space model with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we achieved a significant reduction in the variance of parameter estimates. The algorithm did not require the explicit formulation of a cost function and it was straightforward to apply on compartmental models and multiple data sets. Overall, the proposed methodology is particularly suitable for resolving high-dimensional inference problems based on noisy electrophysiological data and, therefore, a potentially useful tool in the construction of biophysical neuron models.},

A modified version of the Luo-Rudy phase II action potential model was used to simulate the electrical behavior of one ventricular myocyte during 14 min of simulated ischemia. Our results show the following: 1) only the integrated effect of activation of ATP-dependent K+ current, an ischemic Na+ inward current, and inhibition of Na(+)-K(+) pump activity in the absence of coronary flow replicates the biphasic time course of extracellular K+ concentration observed during acute ischemia; 2) the time to onset of the plateau phase and the plateau level value are determined by the rate of stimulation and by the rate of alteration of the three mechanisms. However, acidosis and reduction of extracellular volume produce only a slight anticipation of the plateau phase; and 3) cellular K+ loss is mainly due to an increase of K+ efflux via the time-independent K+ current and ATP-dependent K+ current rather than to a decrease of K+ influx.},

abstract = {Pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) exhibits limited efficacy. Further developments require a comprehensive characterization of ionic modulators of electrophysiology in human atria. Our aim is to systematically investigate the relative importance of ionic properties in modulating excitability, refractoriness and rotor dynamics in human atria before and after AF-related electrical remodeling (AFER). Computer simulations of single cell and tissue atrial electrophysiology were conducted using two human atrial action potential (AP) models. Changes in AP, refractory period (RP), conduction velocity (CV) and rotor dynamics caused by alterations in key properties of all atrial ionic currents were characterized before and after AFER. Results show that the investigated human atrial electrophysiological properties are primarily modulated by maximal value of Na(+)/K(+) pump current (G(NaK)) as well as conductances of inward rectifier potassium current (G(K1)) and fast inward sodium current (G(Na)). G(NaK) plays a fundamental role through both electrogenic and homeostatic modulation of AP duration (APD), APD restitution, RP, and reentrant dominant frequency (DF). G(K1) controls DF through modulation of AP, APD restitution, RP and CV. G(Na) is key in determining DF through alteration of CV and RP, particularly in AFER. Changes in ionic currents have qualitatively similar effects in control and AFER, but effects are smaller in AFER. The systematic analysis conducted in this study unravels the important role of the Na(+)/K(+) pump current in determining human atrial electrophysiology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously showed that the cardioversion threshold (CVT) for ventricular tachycardia (VT) is phase dependent when a single monophasic shock (1MP) is used. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to extend these findings to a biphasic shock (1BP) and to compare the efficacy of phase-independent multiple monophasic (5MP) and biphasic shocks (5BP). METHODS: Panoramic optical mapping with blebbistatin (5 microM) was performed in postmyocardial infarction rabbit hearts (n = 8). Flecainide (1.64 +/- 0.68 microM) was administered to promote sustained arrhythmias. 5MP and 5BP were applied within one VT cycle length (CL). Results were compared to 1BP and antitachycardia pacing. RESULTS: We observed monomorphic VT with CL = 149.6 +/- 18.0 ms. Similar to 1MP, CVTs of 1BP were found to be phase dependent, and the maximum versus minimum CVT was 8.6 +/- 1.7 V/cm versus 3.7 +/- 1.9 V/cm, respectively (P = .0013). Efficacy of 5MP was higher than that of 1BP and 5BP. CVT was 3.2 +/- 1.4 V/cm for 5MP versus 5.3 +/- 1.9 V/cm for 5BP (P = .00027). 5MP versus averaged 1BP CVT was 3.6 +/- 2.1 V/cm versus. 6.8 +/- 1.5 V/cm, respectively (P = .00024). Antitachycardia pacing was found to be completely ineffective in this model. CONCLUSION: Maintenance of shock-induced virtual electrode polarization by multiple monophasic shocks over a VT cycle is responsible for unpinning of reentry leading to self-termination. Elimination of virtual electrode polarization by shock polarity reversal during multiple biphasic shocks proved ineffective. A significant reduction in CVT can be achieved by applying multiple monophasic shocks within one VT CL or one single shock at the proper coupling interval.},

abstract = {Reentry is the main mechanism of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia. Its occurrence depends on the simultaneous presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate (a preexisting condition) and a "trigger," and is favored by electrophysiological heterogeneities. In the adult heart, electrophysiological heterogeneities of the ventricle exist along the apicobasal, left-right, and transmural axes. Also, conduction is preferentially slowed in the right ventricular outflow tract, especially during pharmacological sodium channel blockade. We propose that the origin of electrophysiological heterogeneities of the adult heart lies in early heart development. The heart is formed from several progenitor regions: the first heart field predominantly forms the left ventricle, whereas the second heart field forms the right ventricle and outflow tract. Furthermore, the embryonic outflow tract consists of slowly conducting tissue until it is incorporated into the ventricles and develops rapidly conducting properties. The subepicardial myocytes and subendocardial myocytes run distinctive gene programs from their formation onwards. This review discusses the hypothesis that electrophysiological heterogeneities in the adult heart result from persisting patterns in gene expression and function along the craniocaudal and epicardial-endocardial axes of the developing heart. Understanding the developmental origins of electrophysiological heterogeneity contributing to ventricular arrhythmias may give rise to new therapies.},

abstract = {A progressively increasing number of cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolong the ventricular action potential duration (QT interval of the electrocardiogram) and cause a distinctive polymorphic ventricular tachycardia termed torsades de pointes (TdP) that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Drugs prolong the QT interval and cause TdP by blocking cardiac K+ channels in general and selectively blocking the rapidly activating delayed rectifier channel IKr. Coassembly of HERG (human-ether-a-go-go-related gene) alpha-subunits and MiRP1 (MinK-related peptide 1) beta-subunits recapitulate the behavior of native human IKr and mutations of HERG and MiRP1 decrease the repolarizing current, delay ventricular repolarization and prolong the QT. Thus, drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP might represent an iatrogenic reproduction of the congenital LQTS. In patients with silent forms of the congenital LQTS associated with mutations in IKr, arrhythmic symptoms developed almost exclusively after exposure to QT-prolonging drugs. This review centers on the possible cellular mechanisms underlying drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP, the description of specific drugs and risk factors facilitating the development of TdP, and the recommendations for preventing and treating this potentially fatal arrhythmia.},

Although the end of repolarization closely corresponds to the end of refractoriness in the well-perfused, well-oxygenated myocardium, it is no longer true for the ischemic myocardium, in which the recovery of excitability lags behind full repolarization. The purpose the study was to review this phenomenon of postrepolarization refractoriness during ischemia and after application of various antiarrhythmic drugs. The findings showed that although postrepolarization refractoriness is profoundly proarrhythmic during ischemia, it may protect the heart from reentrant arrhythmias in the absence of depolarization of the resting membrane. An increase in postrepolarization refractoriness induced by sodium-channel-blocking drugs may exert an antifibrillatory action.},

abstract = {Sustained elevation in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration via Ca2+ influx, which is activated by a variety of mechanisms, plays a central regulatory role for cardiovascular functions. Recent molecular biological research has disclosed an unexpectedly diverse array of Ca(2+-entry channel molecules involved in this Ca2+ influx. These include more than ten transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily members such as TRPC1, TRPC3-6, TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPM4, TRPM7, and polycystin (TRPP2). Most of them appear to be multimodally activated or modulated and show relevant features to both acute hemodynamic control and long-term remodeling of the cardiovascular system, and many of them have been found to respond not only to receptor stimulation but also to various forms of stimuli. There is good evidence to implicate TRPC1 in neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury via store-depletion-operated Ca2+ entry. TRPC6 likely contributes to receptor-operated and mechanosensitive Ca2+ mobilizations, being involved in vasoconstrictor and myogenic responses and pulmonary arterial proliferation and its associated disease (idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension). Considerable evidence has also been accumulated for unique involvement of TRPV1 in blood flow/pressure regulation via sensory vasoactive neuropeptide release. New lines of evidence suggest that TRPV2 may act as a Ca2+-overloading pathway associated with dystrophic cardiomyopathy, TRPV4 as a mediator of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization, TRPM7 as a proproliferative vascular Mg2+ entry channel, and TRPP2 as a Ca2+-entry channel requisite for vascular integrity. This review attempts to provide an overview of the current knowledge on TRP proteins and discuss their possible roles in cardiovascular functions and diseases.},

abstract = {The number of mathematical models of cardiac cellular excitability is rapidly growing, and compact graphical representations of their properties can make new acquisitions available for a broader range of scientists in cardiac field. Particularly, the intrinsic over-determination of the model equations systems when fitted only to action potential (AP) waveform and the fact that they are frequently tuned on data covering only a relatively narrow range of dynamic conditions, often lead modellers to compare very similar AP profiles, which underlie though quite different excitable properties. In this study I discuss a novel compact 3D representation of the cardiac cellular AP, where the third dimension represents the instantaneous current-voltage profile of the membrane, measured as repolarization proceeds. Measurements of this type have been used previously for in vivo experiments, and are adopted here iteratively at a very high time, voltage, current-resolution on (i) the same human ventricular model, endowed with two different parameters sets which generate the same AP waveform, and on (ii) three different models of the same human ventricular cell type. In these 3D representations, the AP waveforms lie at the intersection between instantaneous time-voltage-current surfaces and the zero-current plane. Different surfaces can share the same intersection and therefore the same AP; in these cases, the morphology of the current surface provides a compact view of important differences within corresponding repolarization dynamics. Refractory period, supernormal excitability window, and extent of repolarization reserve can be visualized at once. Two pivotal dynamical properties can be precisely assessed, i.e. all-or-nothing repolarization window and membrane resistance during recovery. I discuss differences in these properties among the membranes under study, and show relevant implications for cardiac cellular repolarization.},

abstract = {After sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ depletion in intact ventricular myocytes, electrical activity promotes SR Ca2+ reloading and recovery of twitch amplitude. In ferret, recovery of twitch and caffeine-induced contracture required fewer twitches than in rabbit or rat. In rat, there was no difference in action potential duration at 90\% repolarization (APD90) at steady state (SS) versus at the first post-depletion (PD) twitch. The SS APD90 was similar in ferret and rabbit (but longer than in rat). However, compared to SS, the PD APD90 was lengthened in ferret, but shortened in rabbit. When rabbit myocytes were subjected to AP-clamp patterns during SR Ca2+ reloading (ferret- or rabbit-type APs), reloading was much faster using the ferret AP templates. We conclude that the faster SR Ca2+ refilling in ferret is due to the increased Ca2+ influx during the longer PD AP. The PD versus SS APD90 difference was suppressed by thapsigargin in ferret (indicating Ca2+ dependence). In rabbit, the PD AP shortening depended on the preceding diastolic interval (rather than Ca2+), because rest produced the same AP shortening, and SS APD90 increased as a function of frequency (in contrast to ferret). Transient outward current (Ito) was larger and recovered from inactivation much faster in ferret than in rabbit. Moreover, slow Ito recovery (tau approximately 3 s) in rabbit was a much larger fraction of Ito. Our data and a computational model (including two Ito components) suggest that in rabbit the slowly recovering Ito is responsible for short post-rest and PD APs, for the unusual frequency dependence of APD90, and ultimately for the slower post-depletion SR Ca2+ reloading.},

abstract = {Conduction slowing is an essential element in the generation of ischemic ventricular arrhythmias and is determined in part by the inward Na+ current (INa). Because intracellular acidosis is an early consequence of ischemia, we hypothesized that lowering intracellular pH (pHi) would reduce or kinetically modulate INa and thus affect cardiac conduction. To test this hypothesis, the whole cell patch-clamp method was used to measure INa in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes exposed to varying extracellular pH (pHo 6.4-7.4), while perfusing the cells with acidic solutions (pHi 6.2-7.2). With simultaneous acidification of pHo and pHi there was a progressive increase in time to peak current, a 31\% decrease in peak INa (298 +/- 18 to 206 +/- 16 pA/pF), and a complex slowing of inactivation kinetics. At the most extreme levels of acidification, there was a 5-mV hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation and a 6-mV depolarizing shift in activation. Independent changes of pHo and pHi indicate that the reduction of peak INa is a function of pHo. However, steady-state inactivation is modulated by pHi. The time course of activation and inactivation appears to depend on both pHo and pHi. We conclude that both intracellular and extracellular acidosis are significant but distinct modulators of INa amplitude and kinetics in cardiac myocytes.},

abstract = {The high incidence of sudden cardiac death in heart failure (HF) reflects electrophysiologic changes in response to myocardial failure. We previously showed that short-term variability of QT intervals (STV(QT)) identifies latent repolarization disorders in patients with drug-induced or congenital long QT syndrome. This study sought to determine (1) if STV(QT) is increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) and moderate congestive HF and (2) if increased STV(QT) is associated with ventricular arrhythmia in patients with HF. Sixty patients (53 +/- 12 years of age, 14 women) with DC and moderate HF (New York Heart Association classes II to III) were compared to matched controls. Twenty patients had implantable cardiac defibrillators secondary to a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Two cardiologists blinded to diagnosis manually measured QT intervals. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization was determined from Poincar\'{e} plots of 30 consecutive QT intervals as was STV(QT). QTc intervals were comparable in patients and controls (419 +/- 36 vs 415 +/- 32 ms, respectively, p >0.05), whereas STV(QT) was significantly higher in patients with HF (7.8 +/- 3 vs 4.1 +/- 2 ms, respectively, p <0.05). STV(QT) was more increased in patients with a history of VT compared to those without VT (10.1 +/- 2 vs 6.6 +/- 2 ms, respectively, p <0.05). Increased STV(QT) and decreased ejection fraction were associated with a history of VT; however, STV(QT) was the strongest indicator. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that STV(QT) is increased in patients with DC with HF. Patients with DC and HF and implantable cardiac defibrillators for secondary prevention had the highest STV(QT). Thus, increased STV(QT) in the context of moderate HF may reflect a latent repolarization disorder and increased susceptibility to sudden death in patients with DC, which is not identified by a prolonged QT interval.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death is one of the major causes of death in the industrialized world. It is most often caused by a cardiac arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Despite its large social and economical impact, the mechanisms for VF in the human heart yet remain to be identified. Two of the most frequently discussed mechanisms observed in experiments with animal hearts are the multiple wavelet and mother rotor hypotheses. Most recordings of VF in animal hearts are consistent with the multiple wavelet mechanism. However, in animal hearts, mother rotor fibrillation has also been observed. For both multiple wavelet and mother rotor VF, cardiac heterogeneity plays an important role. Clinical data of action potential restitution measured from the surface of human hearts have been recently published. These in vivo data show a substantial degree of spatial heterogeneity. Using these clinical restitution data, we studied the dynamics of VF in the human heart using a heterogeneous computational model of human ventricles. We hypothesized that this observed heterogeneity can serve as a substrate for mother rotor fibrillation. We found that, based on these data, mother rotor VF can occur in the human heart and that ablation of the mother rotor terminates VF. Furthermore, we found that both mother rotor and multiple wavelet VF can occur in the same heart depending on the initial conditions at the onset of VF. We studied the organization of these two types of VF in terms of filament numbers, excitation periods, and frequency domains. We conclude that mother rotor fibrillation is a possible mechanism in the human heart.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coexistence of cardiac hypertrophy (H) and ischemia (I) can create a particularly arrhythmogenic substrate. Most studies investigate the effects of global I on H. However, global I is not a good surrogate model of the clinical situation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the electrophysiological effects of regional I superimposed on H using optical mapping of membrane voltage. METHODS: We investigated the guinea pig model of left ventricular H (LVH) induced by suprarenal banding of abdominal aorta. Twelve hearts with or without LVH were mounted in a Langendorff preparation, and regional I was induced by 20 minutes of ligation of the left anterior descending artery. RESULTS: Left ventricle epicardial action potential duration (APD) was significantly prolonged in the LVH group compared with controls. I significantly shortened APD in the I risk zone in both groups, but the percentages of APD shortening (28\% vs. 40\%) and the magnitudes of shortening (57 +/- 18 vs. 105 +/- 32 ms) were greater in the LVH group. The greater dispersion of repolarization (DR) across the border of the I zone resulted in arcs of functional conduction block and circulating wave fronts. Tachycardia-dependent APD alternans developed more often in the LVH group, and the area of alternans versus the area of the I zone was significantly larger. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) developed in all 12 hearts with LVH including six non-self-terminating VTs, compared with four control hearts with self-terminating VT. CONCLUSION: Regional I superimposed on LVH resulted in greater DR at the border between the I and non-I zones as well as in a greater tendency to develop APD alternans. Both arrhythmogenic mechanisms correlated with an increased incidence of VT.},

abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of wave propagation in human ventricular tissue and studying wave stability require models that reproduce realistic characteristics in tissue. We present a minimal ventricular (MV) human model that is designed to reproduce important tissue-level characteristics of epicardial, endocardial and midmyocardial cells, including action potential (AP) amplitudes and morphologies, upstroke velocities, steady-state action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity (CV) restitution curves, minimum APD, and minimum diastolic interval. The model is then compared with three previously published human ventricular cell models, the Priebe and Beuckelmann (PB), the Ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov (TNNP), and the Iyer-Mazhari-Winslow (IMW). For the first time, the stability of reentrant waves for all four models is analyzed, and quantitative comparisons are made among the models in single cells and in tissue. The PB, TNNP, and IMW models exhibit quantitative differences in APD and CV rate adaptation, as well as completely different reentrant wave dynamics of quasi-breakup, stability, and breakup, respectively. All the models have dominant frequencies comparable to clinical values except for the IMW model, which has a large range of frequencies extending beyond the clinical range for both ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The TNNP and IMW models possess a large degree of short-term memory and we show for the first time the existence of memory in CV restitution. The MV model also can be fitted to reproduce the dynamics of other models and is computationally more efficient: the times required to simulate the MV, TNNP, PB and IMW models follow the ratio 1:31:50:8084.},

abstract = {With the advent of thrombolytic therapy and angioplasty, it has become possible to reduce myocardial infarct size through early reperfusion. Enormous effort has been expended to find therapies that can further reduce infarct size after early intervention. Animal studies have identified many cardioprotective pathways that have the potential to reduce infarct size if activated before the onset of ischemia. More recently, interventions effective at the onset of reperfusion have been described. Although basic research has identified many targets, most has been conducted in rodent models which may not be directly applicable to human disease and even promising agents have been disappointing in large-scale clinical trials. There are many potential explanations for this failure which is the subject of this review. Potential factors include (1) the variability inherent in the patient population, whereas animal studies usually use single sex homogeneous groups maintained on standard diets in carefully controlled environments; (2) the duration of ischemia is generally shorter in animal studies, resulting in potentially more salvageable myocardium than is often the case in patients; (3) that the animals are usually young without comorbidities, whereas the patient population is generally older and has significant comorbidities; (4) animals are not treated with medications a priori, whereas the patient population is often taking medications that may affect ischemic injury; and (5) animal studies may not involve thorough assessment of effects on organs other than the heart, whereas patients can experience adverse effects of treatment in other organs that can preclude clinical use.},

@article{Carusi2012,
abstract = {Computational models in physiology often integrate functional and structural information from a large range of spatiotemporal scales from the ionic to the whole organ level. Their sophistication raises both expectations and skepticism concerning how computational methods can improve our understanding of living organisms and also how they can reduce, replace, and refine animal experiments. A fundamental requirement to fulfill these expectations and achieve the full potential of computational physiology is a clear understanding of what models represent and how they can be validated. The present study aims at informing strategies for validation by elucidating the complex interrelations among experiments, models, and simulations in cardiac electrophysiology. We describe the processes, data, and knowledge involved in the construction of whole ventricular multiscale models of cardiac electrophysiology. Our analysis reveals that models, simulations, and experiments are intertwined, in an assemblage that is a system itself, namely the model-simulation-experiment (MSE) system. We argue that validation is part of the whole MSE system and is contingent upon 1) understanding and coping with sources of biovariability; 2) testing and developing robust techniques and tools as a prerequisite to conducting physiological investigations; 3) defining and adopting standards to facilitate the interoperability of experiments, models, and simulations; 4) and understanding physiological validation as an iterative process that contributes to defining the specific aspects of cardiac electrophysiology the MSE system targets, rather than being only an external test, and that this is driven by advances in experimental and computational methods and the combination of both.},

abstract = {The effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on the genera- tion of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) and transmu- ral dispersion of repolarization (TDR) were assessed using arterially perfused rabbit ventricular wedge preparations. Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, suben- docardium, and endocardium were simultaneously recorded together with a transmural ECG. Transmural action poten- tial duration (APD) was also mapped. LVH (renovascular hypertension model) produced significant prolongation in ventricular APD and QT interval. Preferential APD prolon- gation in subendocardium and endocardium was associated with a marked increase in TDR. Phase 2 EADs were gener- ated from subendocardium or endocardium in all LVH rab- bits (15 of 15) in the absence of APD prolonging agents at basic cycle lengths of 2,000–4,000 ms. Phase 2 EAD could produce “R on T” extrasystoles, initiating polymorphic ven- tricular tachycardia (VT). This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular recordings that phase 2 EAD could be generated from rabbit intact hypertrophied LV wall in the absence of APD prolonging agents, resulting in R on T extrasystoles capable of initiating polymorphic VT under enhanced TDR.},

@article{Diaz2004,
abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate whether beat-to-beat alternation in the amplitude of the systolic Ca(2+) transient (Ca(2+) alternans) is due to changes of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, and if so, whether the alternans arises due to a change in the gain of the feedback controlling SR Ca(2+) content. We found that, in rat ventricular myocytes, stimulating with small (20 mV) depolarizing pulses produced alternans of the amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient. Confocal measurements showed that the larger transients resulted from propagation of Ca(2+) waves. SR Ca(2+) content (measured from caffeine-evoked membrane currents) alternated in phase with the alternans of Ca(2+) transient amplitude. After a large transient, if SR Ca(2+) content was elevated by brief exposure of the cell to a Na(+)-free solution, then the alternans was interrupted and the next transient was also large. This shows that changes of SR Ca(2+) content are sufficient to produce alternans. The dependence of Ca(2+) transient amplitude on SR content was steeper under alternating than under control conditions. During alternation, the Ca(2+) efflux from the cell was also a steeper function of SR Ca(2+) content than under control. We attribute these steeper relationships to the fact that the larger responses in alternans depend on wave propagation and that wave propagation is a steep function of SR Ca(2+) content. In conclusion, alternans of systolic Ca(2+) appears to depend on alternation of SR Ca(2+) content. This, in turn results from the steep dependence on SR Ca(2+) content of Ca(2+) release and therefore Ca(2+) efflux from the cell as a consequence of wave propagation.},

abstract = {We investigate acute effects of axial stretch, applied by carbon fibers (CFs), on diastolic Ca2+ spark rate in rat isolated cardiomyocytes. CFs were attached either to both cell ends (to maximize the stretched region), or to the center and one end of the cell (to compare responses in stretched and nonstretched half-cells). Sarcomere length was increased by 8.01+/-0.94\% in the stretched cell fraction, and time series of XY confocal images were recorded to monitor diastolic Ca2+ spark frequency and dynamics. Whole-cell stretch causes an acute increase of Ca2+ spark rate (to 130.7+/-6.4\%) within 5 seconds, followed by a return to near background levels (to 104.4+/-5.1\%) within 1 minute of sustained distension. Spark rate increased only in the stretched cell region, without significant differences in spark amplitude, time to peak, and decay time constants of sparks in stretched and nonstretched areas. Block of stretch-activated ion channels (2 micromol/L GsMTx-4), perfusion with Na+/Ca2+-free solution, and block of nitric oxide synthesis (1 mmol/L L-NAME) all had no effect on the stretch-induced acute increase in Ca2+ spark rate. Conversely, interference with cytoskeletal integrity (2 hours of 10 micromol/L colchicine) abolished the response. Subsequent electron microscopic tomography confirmed the close approximation of microtubules with the T-tubular-sarcoplasmic reticulum complex (to within approximately 10(-8)m). In conclusion, axial stretch of rat cardiomyocytes acutely and transiently increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ spark rate via a mechanism that is independent of sarcolemmal stretch-activated ion channels, nitric oxide synthesis, or availability of extracellular calcium but that requires cytoskeletal integrity. The potential of microtubule-mediated modulation of ryanodine receptor function warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Gender disparities in ECG variables and susceptibility to arrhythmia exist. The basis of these sex-related distinctions in cardiac electrophysiology has been extensively studied in various species, but is virtually unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the cellular basis of electrophysiological gender disparities in human cardiac myocytes. Human midmyocardial left ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted hearts of male and female patients in end-stage heart failure at the time of cardiac transplantation. The action potentials, sarcolemmal ion currents, and susceptibility to the generation of early afterdepolarizations were studied using whole-cell patch-clamp methodology. The functional effects of gender disparities in sarcolemmal ion currents were assessed by computer simulations using the Priebe-Beuckelmann or the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov human ventricular cell models. Female myocytes had significantly longer action potentials and greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male myocytes. All other action potential parameters (resting membrane potential, amplitude, plateau level, upstroke velocity, maximal velocity of phase-1 and phase-3 repolarization) had similar values for both genders. In female myocytes, the transient outward potassium current (I(to1)) tended to be smaller, while the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and quasi-steady state current (I(QSS)) tended to be larger. Computer simulations showed that these subtle differences in sarcolemmal ion currents may conspire to cause the observed gender disparities in action potential properties. Female failing myocytes have longer action potentials and a greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male failing myocytes. These gender disparities may be due to slightly larger depolarizing I(Ca,L) in conjunction with slightly smaller repolarizing I(QSS) and I(to1) in female myocytes.},

abstract = {AIM: The human coronary tree is commonly assumed to have two roots: the left and right coronary arteries (LCA and RCA, respectively). However, a third coronary artery (TCA) has been observed in humans and animals, usually arising from the right anterior aortic sinus near the RCA. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, we identified TCA prevalence and characteristics in rabbit and human hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Third coronary artery presence was analysed in hearts from 11 New Zealand white rabbits and 7 human cadavers, using excised tissue that was fixed, gadolinium-treated, and agar-embedded for imaging-based reconstruction. A TCA was identified in all rabbit hearts and six of seven human hearts, originating either from an independent ostium (7 of 11 rabbits, 2 of 7 humans) or an ostium shared with the RCA (4 of 11 rabbits, 4 of 7 humans). Proximal TCA cross-sectional area in rabbits was 15.3 ± 6.0\% of RCA area (mean ± SD, based on n = 9 rabbit hearts in which reliable measurements could be taken for both vessels), and 26.7 ± 10.1\% in humans (n = 4). In all-but-one case where a TCA was observed, it originated ventral to the RCA, progressing towards the right ventricular outflow tract. In one rabbit, the TCA originated dorsal to the RCA and progressed towards the Crista terminalis in the right atrium. A fourth vessel, forming a separate aortic Vas vasorum was occasionally seen, originating from the right anterior aortic sinus either from an ostium common with (1 of 11 rabbits, 0 of 7 humans) or independent of (1 of 11 rabbits, 1 of 7 humans) the TCA. Pilot optical mapping experiments showed that TCA occlusion had variable acute effects on rabbit cardiac electrophysiology. CONCLUSION: Third coronary artery presence is common in rabbit and human hearts. Functional effects of disrupted TCA blood supply are ill-investigated, and the rabbit may be a suitable species for such research.},

abstract = {We have developed a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ handling and ionic currents in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. The objective was to develop a model that: 1), accurately reflects Ca-dependent Ca release; 2), uses realistic parameters, particularly those that concern Ca transport from the cytosol; 3), comes to steady state; 4), simulates basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; and 5), runs on a normal desktop computer. The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na]i dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca]i; and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy. A particular emphasis is placed upon reproducing the nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca release upon SR Ca load. We conclude that this model is more robust than many previously existing models and reproduces many experimental results using parameters based largely on experimental measurements in myocytes.},

This increase of [Ca(2+)](i) was inhibited by nifedipine and the calculated rate of entry of Ca increased on depolarization and then declined with a similar time course to the inactivation of the L-type Ca current. We conclude that this component of change of [Ca(2+)](i) is due to the L-type Ca current. If intracellular Na was elevated then only part of the change of [Ca(2+)](i) was inhibited by nifedipine. The nifedipine-insensitive component increased monotonically with depolarization and showed no relaxation on prolonged depolarization. This component appears to result from Na-Ca exchange (NCX). When the L-type current and NCX were both inhibited (nifedipine and Na-free solution) then depolarization decreased and hyperpolarization increased [Ca(2+)](i). These changes of [Ca(2+)](i) were unaffected by modifiers of B-type Ca channels such as chlorpromazine and AlF(3) but were abolished by gadolinium ions. We conclude that, in addition to L-type Ca channels and NCX, there is another pathway for entry of Ca(2+) into the ventricular myocyte but this is distinct from the previously reported B-type channel.},

abstract = {Under conditions of Na(+) channel hyperactivation with aconitine, the changes in action potential duration (APD) and the restitution characteristics have not been well defined in the context of aconitine-induced arrhythmogenesis. Optical mapping of voltage using RH237 was performed with eight extracted rabbit hearts that were perfused using the Langendorff system. The characteristics of APD restitution were assessed using the steady-state pacing protocol at baseline and 0.1 µM aconitine concentration. In addition, pseudo-ECG was analyzed at baseline, and with 0.1 and 1.0 µM of aconitine infusion respectively. Triggered activity was not shown in dose of 0.1 µM aconitine but overtly presented in 1.0 µM of aconitine. The slopes of the dynamic APD restitution curves were significantly steeper with 0.1 µM of aconitine than at baseline. With aconitine administration, the cycle length of initiation of APD alternans was significantly longer than at baseline (287.5 ± 9.6 vs 247.5 ± 15.0 msec, P = 0.016). The functional reentry following regional conduction block appears with the progression of APD alternans. Ventricular fibrillation is induced reproducibly at pacing cycle length showing a 2:1 conduction block. Low-dose aconitine produces arrhythmogenesis at an increasing restitution slope with APD alternans as well as regional conduction block that proceeds to functional reentry.},

abstract = {Action potential repolarization in the mammalian heart is governed by interactions of a number of time- and voltage-dependent channel-mediated currents, as well as contributions from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the Na+/K+ pump. Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents (HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+ currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle. Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two K+ currents, IK1 and HERG (or IK,r), within the framework of ten Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear K+ conductances, IK1 and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human ventricular tissue and/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s) of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle. Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the human electrocardiogram.},

abstract = {Little is known about the mechanisms of vulnerability and defibrillation under ischemic conditions. We investigated these mechanisms in 18 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts during 75\% reduced-flow ischemia. Electrical activity was optically mapped from the anterior epicardium during right ventricular shocks applied at various phases of the cardiac cycle while the excitation-contraction decoupler 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM; 15 mM) was used to suppress motion artifacts caused by contraction of the heart. During ischemia, vulnerable window width increased [from 30-90\% of the action potential duration (APD) in the control to -10 to 100\% of the APD in ischemia]. Moreover, arrhythmia severity increased along with the reduction of APD (176 +/- 9 ms in control and 129 +/- 26 ms in ischemia, P < 0.01) and increased dispersion of repolarization (45 +/- 17 ms in control and 73 +/- 28 ms in ischemia, P < 0.01). Shock-induced virtual electrode polarization was preserved. Depolarizing (contrary to hyperpolarizing) response time constants increased. Virtual electrode-induced wavefronts of excitation had much more tortuous pathways leading to wavefront fractionation. Defibrillation failure at all shock strengths was observed in four hearts. Optical mapping revealed that the shock extinguished the arrhythmia; however, the arrhythmia self-originated after an isoelectric window of 339 +/- 189 ms. In conclusion, in most cases, virtual electrode-induced phase singularity (VEIPS) was responsible for shock-induced arrhythmogenesis during acute global ischemia. Enhancement of arrhythmogenesis was associated with an increased dispersion of repolarization and altered deexcitation. In four hearts, arrhythmogenesis could not be explained by VEIPS.},

abstract = {A multicellular ventricular fiber model was used to determine mechanisms of slowed conduction and conduction failure during acute ischemia. We simulated the three major pathophysiological component conditions of acute ischemia: elevated [K+]o, acidosis, and anoxia. Elevated [K+]o was the major determinant of conduction, causing supernormal conduction, depressed conduction, and conduction block as [K+]o was gradually increased from 4.5 to 14.4 mmol/L. Only elevated [K+]o caused conduction failure when varied within the range reported for acute ischemia. Before block, depressed upstrokes consisted of two distinct components: the first to the fast Na+ current (INa) and the second to the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa(L)). Even in highly depressed conduction, excitability was maintained by INa, with conduction block occurring at 95\% INa inactivation. However, because ICa(L) supported the later phase of the depressed upstroke, ICa(L) enhanced conduction and delayed block by increasing the electrotonic source current. At [K+]o = 18 mmol/L, slow action potentials generated by ICa(L) were obtained with 10\% ICa(L) augmentation. However, in the presence of acidosis and anoxia, significantly larger (120\%) ICa(L) augmentation was required. The depressant effect was due mostly to anoxic activation of outward ATP-sensitive K+ current, which counteracts inward ICa(L) and, by lowering the action potential amplitude, decreases the electrotonic current available to depolarize downstream cells. The simulations highlight the interactive nature of electrophysiological ischemic changes during propagation and demonstrate that both membrane changes and load factors (by downstream fiber) must be considered.},

abstract = {Phase space methods and an analog computer are used to analyze the Hodgkin-Huxley non-linear differential equations for the squid giant axon membrane. V is the membrane potential, m the Na(+) activation, h the Na(+) inactivation, and n the K(+) activation. V and m change rapidly, relative to h and n. The (V, m) phase plane of a reduced system of equations, with h and n held constant at their resting values, has three singular points: a stable resting point, a threshold saddle point, and a stable excited point. When h and n are allowed to vary, recovery and refractoriness result from the movement with subsequent disappearance of the threshold and excited points. Multiplying the time constant of n by 100 or more, and that of h by one-third, reproduces the experimental plateau action potentials obtained with tetraethylammonium by Tasaki and Hagiwara, including the phenomena of abolition and of refractoriness of the plateau duration. The equations have, transiently, two stable states, as found in the real axon by these authors. Since the theoretical membrane conductance curves differ significantly from the experimental ones, further experimental analysis of ionic currents with tetraethylammonium is needed to decide whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be generalized to explain these experiments completely.},

abstract = {In cardiac tissue, reduced membrane excitability and reduced gap junction coupling both slow conduction velocity of the action potential. However, the ionic mechanisms of slow conduction for the two conditions are very different. We explored, using a multicellular theoretical fiber, the ionic mechanisms and functional role of the fast sodium current, INa, and the L-type calcium current, ICa(L), during conduction slowing for the two fiber conditions. A safety factor for conduction (SF) was formulated and computed for each condition. Reduced excitability caused a lower SF as conduction velocity decreased. In contrast, reduced gap junction coupling caused a paradoxical increase in SF as conduction velocity decreased. The opposite effect of the two conditions on SF was reflected in the minimum attainable conduction velocity before failure: decreased excitability could reduce velocity to only one third of control (from 54 to 17 cm/s) before failure occurred, whereas decreased coupling could reduce velocity to as low as 0.26 cm/s before block. Under normal conditions and conditions of reduced excitability, ICa(L) had a minimal effect on SF and on conduction. However, ICa(L) played a major role in sustaining conduction when intercellular coupling was reduced. This phenomenon demonstrates that structural, nonmembrane factors can cause a switch of intrinsic membrane processes that support conduction. High intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca]i, lowered propagation safety and caused earlier block when intercellular coupling was reduced. [Ca]i affected conduction via calcium-dependent inactivation of ICa(L). The increase of safety factor during reduced coupling suggests a major involvement of uncoupling in stable slow conduction in infarcted myocardium, making microreentry possible. Reliance on ICa(L) for this type of conduction suggests ICa(L) as a possible target for antiarrhythmic drug therapy.},

abstract = {Patients with structural heart disease are predisposed to arrhythmias by incompletely understood mechanisms. We hypothesized that tissue expansions promote source-to-sink mismatch leading to early after-depolarizations (EADs) and reflection of impulses in monolayers of well-polarized neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.We traced electrical propagation optically in patterned monolayers consisting of two wide regions connected by a thin isthmus.Structural heterogeneities provided a substrate for EADs, retrograde propagation along the same pathway (reflection) and reentry initiation. Reflection always originated during the action potential (AP) plateau at the distal expansion. To determine whether increased sodium current(INa) would promote EADs, we employed adenoviral transfer of Nav1.5 (Ad-Nav1.5). Compared with uninfected and adenoviral expression of green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP; viral control),Ad-Nav1.5 significantly increased Nav1.5 protein expression, peak and persistent INa density, A Pupstroke velocity, AP duration, conduction velocity and EAD incidence, as well as reflection incidence (29.2\%, n =48 vs. uninfected, 9.4\%, n =64; and Ad-GFP, 4.8\%, n =21). Likewise,the persistent INa agonist veratridine (0.05–3 $\mu$M) prolonged the AP, leading to EADs and reflection. Reflection led to functional reentry distally and bigeminal and trigeminal rhythms proximally. Reflection was rare in the absence of structural heterogeneities.Computer simulations demonstrated the importance of persistent INa in triggering reflection and predicted that the gradient between the depolarizing cells at the distal expansion and the repolarizing cells within the isthmus enabled retrograde flow of depolarizing electrotonic current to trigger EADs and reflection. A combination of a substrate (structural heterogeneity) and a trigger (increased persistent INa and EADs) promotes reflection and arrhythmogenesis.},

abstract = {Cardiac arrhythmia is the disruption of the normal electrical rhythm of the heart and is a leading cause of mortality around the world. To study arrhythmogenesis, mathematical models of cardiac myocytes and tissues have been effectively employed to investigate cardiac electrodynamics. However, among individual myocytes, there is phenotypic variability that is dependent on factors such as source location in the heart, genetic variation, and even different experimental protocols. Thus, established cardiac myocyte models constrained by experimental data are often untuned to new phenomena under investigation. In this study, we show direct links to parameter changes and differing electrical phenotypes. First, we present results exploring model sensitivity to physiological parameters underpinning electrical activity. Second, we outline a genetic algorithm based approach for tuning model parameters to fit cardiac myocyte behavior. Third, we use a genetic algorithm to transform one model type to another, relating simulation to experimental data. This model transformation demonstrates the potential of genetic algorithms to extend the utility of cardiac myocyte models by comparing different functional regions in the heart.},

abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with reperfusion of ischemic myocardium were delineated with a computerized, three-dimensional mapping system, with simultaneous eight-level transmural recordings from 232 bipolar sites. In six chloralose-anesthetized cats, regional ischemia was induced for 10 min by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by reperfusion. At 10 min after ischemia, just before reperfusion, total ventricular activation time during sinus rhythm was significantly delayed (63 +/- 8 vs 25 +/- 2 msec before ischemia, p less than .001). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred within 15 sec after reperfusion and in three animals culminated in ventricular fibrillation. In 75\% of cases of nonsustained VT, initiation occurred in the subendocardium, at the border of the reperfused zone via a mechanism not involving reentry, as determined by the fact that continuous activation was not apparent and the time from the end of the sinus beat to the beginning of VT (142 +/- 14 msec) was not associated with any intervening depolarizations. In the remaining 25\% of cases of nonsustained VT, initiation of the VT resulted from intramural reentry in the subendocardium adjacent to the site of delayed midmyocardial activation from the preceding sinus beat (total activation time = 151 +/- 9 msec, p less than .001 vs just before reperfusion). This reentrant mechanism was similar to that responsible for the majority of cases of VT during ischemia without reperfusion. Maintenance of VT during reperfusion occurred by nonreentrant mechanisms as well as by intramural reentry, with most cases of VT involving both mechanisms. Ventricular tachycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation was initiated in the subendocardium at the border of the reperfused zone by a nonreentrant mechanism and was maintained by both nonreentrant and reentrant mechanisms, at times in combination in the same beat. The coupling interval of the first ectopic beat of VT leading to ventricular fibrillation was not significantly different from that of nonsustained VT (199 +/- 16 vs 189 +/- 9 msec, p = NS). However, during the transition from VT to ventricular fibrillation, nonreentrant mechanisms arising both in the subendocardium and subepicardium led to very rapid acceleration of the tachycardia to the coupling interval of 92 +/- 2 msec, resulting in enhanced functional block and further conduction delay, with the total activation time of the transition beats exceeding the coupling interval of the tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {It is not clear what factors contribute to the prompt and reversible decrease in left ventricular diastolic chamber distensibility during angina pectoris that is induced by an increase in myocardial energy demand due to exercise or pacing tachycardia. To simulate the demand ischemia that occurs clinically during pacing-induced angina, we used isolated, blood-perfused rabbit hearts with restricted coronary flow and increased myocardial energy demand. A constant left ventricular balloon volume model was used to measure left ventricular diastolic chamber distensibility during 6 minutes of low-flow global ischemia, induced by a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure from 100 to 20 mm Hg. To investigate the influence of different levels of myocardial energy demand, the effects of two different heart rates were studied during low-flow global ischemia; pacing tachycardia (6.4 +/- 0.2 Hz, n = 7) was compared with the rabbit's baseline heart rate of 4 Hz (n = 7). Low-flow ischemia caused a marked decrease in contractile function relative to the baseline preischemic state. In the pacing-tachycardia group, myocardial energy demand, as estimated by the rate X systolic pressure product, was significantly greater than in the constant heart-rate group. When tachycardia was imposed during low-flow global ischemia, there was a transient and reversible increase in isovolumic left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 14 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 4 mm Hg (measured during long diastoles obtained with transient cessation of pacing) in the pacing-tachycardia group, but there was no increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during low flow ischemia in the constant heart-rate group with lower energy demand (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Inactivation of sodium conductance has been studied in squid axons with voltage clamp techniques and with the enzyme pronase which selectively destroys inactivation. Comparison of the sodium current before and after pronase treatment shows a lag of several hundred microseconds in the onset of inactivation after depolarization. This lag can of several hundred microseconds in the onset of inactivation after polarization. This lag can also be demonstrated with double-pulse experiments. When the membrane potential is hyperpolarized to -140 mV before depolarization, both activation and inactivation are delayed. These findings suggest that inactivation occurs only after activation are delayed. These findings suggest that inactivation occurs only after activation; i.e. that the channels must open before they can inactivate. The time constant of inactivation measured with two pulses (tau(c)) is the same as the one measured from the decay of the sodium current during a single pulse (tau(h)). For large depolarizations, steady-state inactivation becomes more incomplete as voltage increases; but it is relatively complete and appears independent of voltage when determined with a two- pulse method. This result confirms the existence of a second open state for Na channels, as proposed by Chandler and Meves (1970. J. Physiol. [Lond.]. 211:653-678). The time constant of recovery from inactivation is voltage dependent and decreases as the membrane potential is made more negative. A model for Na channels is presented which has voltage-dependent transitions between the closed and open states, and a voltage-independent transition between the open and the inactivated state. In this model the voltage dependence of inactivation is a consequence of coupling to the activation process.},

abstract = {Enhanced temporal and spatial variability in cardiac repolarization has been related to increased arrhythmic risk both clinically and experimentally. Causes and modulators of variability in repolarization and their implications in arrhythmogenesis are however not well understood. At the ionic level, the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)) is an important determinant of ventricular repolarization. In this study, a combination of experimental and computational multiscale studies is used to investigate the role of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in I(Ks) in modulating temporal and spatial variability in ventricular repolarization in human and guinea pig. Results show that under physiological conditions: i), stochastic fluctuations in I(Ks) gating properties (i.e., intrinsic noise) cause significant beat-to-beat variability in action potential duration (APD) in isolated cells, whereas cell-to-cell differences in channel numbers (i.e., extrinsic noise) also contribute to cell-to-cell APD differences; ii), in tissue, electrotonic interactions mask the effect of I(Ks) noise, resulting in a significant decrease in APD temporal and spatial variability compared to isolated cells. Pathological conditions resulting in gap junctional uncoupling or a decrease in repolarization reserve uncover the manifestation of I(Ks) noise at cellular and tissue level, resulting in enhanced ventricular variability and abnormalities in repolarization such as afterdepolarizations and alternans.},

abstract = {The local control theory of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac muscle asserts that L-type Ca(2+) current tightly controls Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via local interaction of closely apposed L-type Ca(2+) channels (LCCs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). These local interactions give rise to smoothly graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR), which exhibits high gain. In this study we present a biophysically detailed model of the normal canine ventricular myocyte that conforms to local control theory. The model formulation incorporates details of microscopic EC coupling properties in the form of Ca(2+) release units (CaRUs) in which individual sarcolemmal LCCs interact in a stochastic manner with nearby RyRs in localized regions where junctional SR membrane and transverse-tubular membrane are in close proximity. The CaRUs are embedded within and interact with the global systems of the myocyte describing ionic and membrane pump/exchanger currents, SR Ca(2+) uptake, and time-varying cytosolic ion concentrations to form a model of the cardiac action potential (AP). The model can reproduce both the detailed properties of EC coupling, such as variable gain and graded SR Ca(2+) release, and whole-cell phenomena, such as modulation of AP duration by SR Ca(2+) release. Simulations indicate that the local control paradigm predicts stable APs when the L-type Ca(2+) current is adjusted in accord with the balance between voltage- and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation processes as measured experimentally, a scenario where common pool models become unstable. The local control myocyte model provides a means for studying the interrelationship between microscopic and macroscopic behaviors in a manner that would not be possible in experiments.},

abstract = {Periods of tachycardia were induced in isolated segments (15 X 15 mm) of rabbit left atrium by local application of a properly timed premature stimulus. We used a special device for multiple synchronous microelectrode recordings of responses of more than 100 fibers during the initiation of tachycardia. We clearly demonstrated circus movement of the impulse through a small area of atrial muscle as the underlying mechanism. The premature impulse was conducted antegrade in only one direction, whereas in the other directions antegrade conduction failed. The local responses of the fibers in the blocked area served as a temporary obstacle for return of the premature impulse. When these fibers recovered their excitability before extinction of the premature impulse, they were reentered in a retrograde direction, and the impulse traveled in a circular route. During the propagation of a premature beat, local block, which set the stage for circus movement, was caused by nonuniform recovery of excitability of the atrium. We related the spread of activation of a premature impulse to the naturally occurring spatial dispersion in refractory periods and found that local conduction block invariably was associated with an area of delayed restoration of excitability. Artificial induction of differences in refractory periods by regional application of carbamylcholine made it clear that a disparity in refractory periods of only 11-6 msec between adjacent areas may be sufficient to cause local conduction block of a properly timed premature impulse.},

abstract = {Computational models of electrical activity and calcium signaling in cardiac myocytes are important tools for understanding physiology. The sensitivity of these models to changes in parameters is often not well-understood, however, because parameter evaluation can be a time-consuming, tedious process. I demonstrate here what I believe is a novel method for rapidly determining how changes in parameters affect outputs. In three models of the ventricular action potential, parameters were randomized, repeated simulations were run, important outputs were calculated, and multivariable regression was performed on the collected results. Random parameters included both maximal rates of ion transport and gating variable characteristics. The procedure generated simplified, empirical models that predicted outputs resulting from new sets of input parameters. The linear regression models were quite accurate, despite nonlinearities in the mechanistic models. Moreover, the regression coefficients, which represent parameter sensitivities, were robust, even when parameters were varied over a wide range. Most importantly, a side-by-side comparison of two similar models identified fundamental differences in model behavior, and revealed model predictions that were both consistent with, and inconsistent with, experimental data. This new method therefore shows promise as a tool for the characterization and assessment of computational models. The general strategy may also suggest methods for integrating traditional quantitative models with large-scale data sets obtained using high-throughput technologies.},

abstract = {There has been considerable controversy regarding the role of oxygen free radicals as important mediators of cell damage in reperfused myocardium. This controversy regards whether superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals are generated on reperfusion and if these radicals actually cause impaired contractile function. In this study, EPR studies using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-n-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate the formation of .OH and R. free radicals in the reperfused heart. EPR signals of DMPO-OH, aN = aH = 14.9 G, and DMPO-R aN = 15.8 G aH = 22.8 G are observed, with peak concentrations during the first minute of reperfusion. It is demonstrated that these radicals are derived from .O2- since reperfusion in the presence of enzymatically active recombinant human superoxide dismutase markedly reduced the formation of these signals while inactive recombinant human superoxide dismutase had no effect. On reperfusion with perfusate pretreated to remove adventitial iron, the concentration of the DMPO-OH signal was increased 2-fold and a 4-fold decrease in the DMPO-R signal was observed demonstrating that iron-mediated Fenton chemistry occurs. Hearts reperfused with recombinant human superoxide dismutase exhibited improved contractile function in parallel with the marked reduction in measured free radicals. In order to determine if the reperfusion free radical burst results in impaired contractile function, simultaneous measurements of free radical generation and contractile function were performed. A direct relationship between free radical generation and subsequent impaired contractile function was observed. These studies suggest that superoxide derived .OH and R. free radicals are generated in the reperfused heart via Fenton chemistry. These radicals appear to be key mediators of myocardial reperfusion injury.},

abstract = {There is continued interest in the concept of limiting myocardial infarct size with adjunctive agents administered along with reperfusion injury; however, there remains considerable controversy in the literature. The purpose of this article is to review the medical literature on clinical trials performed during the past 3 years that have attempted to reduce myocardial infarct size by administration of adjunctive therapies along with reperfusion therapy. A PubMed-driven literature search revealed a host of clinical trials focusing on the following prominent types of therapies: endogenous conditioning (postconditioning and remote ischemic conditioning); rapid cooling; pharmacological therapy (cyclosporine, abciximab, clopidogrel, tirofiban, erythropoietin, thrombus aspiration, adenosine, glucose–insulin–potassium, statins, antidiabetic agents, FX06, iron chelation, and ranolazine). Although there remains some controversy, quite a few of these studies showed that adjunctive therapy further reduced myocardial infarct size when coupled with reperfusion. Antiplatelet agents are emerging as some of the newest agents that seem to have cardioprotective capabilities. Postconditioning has become a bit more controversial in the clinical literature; remote conditioning, early and rapid cooling, adenosine, and ranolazine are intriguing therapies deserving of larger studies. Certain agents and maneuvers, such as erythropoietin, protein kinase C $\delta$ inhibitors, iron chelation, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, perhaps should be retired. The correct adjunctive therapy administered along with reperfusion has the capability of further reducing myocardial injury during ST -segment–elevation myocardial infarction},

abstract = {Epicardial cells are more susceptible to the electrophysiological effects of ischemia than are endocardial cells. To explore the ionic basis for the differential electrophysiological responses to ischemia at the two sites, we used patch-clamp techniques to study the effects of ATP depletion on action potential duration and the ability of ATP-regulated K+ channels in single cells isolated from feline left ventricular endocardial and epicardial surfaces. During ATP depletion by treatment with 1 mM cyanide (CN-), shortening of action potential durations was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. Thirty minutes after initiating exposure to 1 mM CN-, action potential duration at 90\% repolarization was reduced to 0.70 +/- 0.12 of the control value for endocardial cells versus 0.39 +/- 0.18 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01), and action potential duration at 20\% repolarization was reduced to 0.72 +/- 0.13 for endocardial cells versus 0.12 +/- 0.09 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). In both endocardial and epicardial cells, the shortening of action potential by CN- treatment was partially reversed by 0.3 microM glibenclamide; the magnitude of reversal, however, was much greater in epicardial cells. After exposure to 1 mM CN-, the activity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in cell-attached membrane patches was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. To study the dose-response relation between ATP concentration and open-state probability of the channels, intracellular surfaces of inside-out membrane patches containing ATP-regulated K+ channels were exposed to various concentrations of ATP (10-1,000 microM). The concentration of ATP that produced half-maximal inhibition of the channel was 23.6 +/- 21.9 microM in endocardial cells and 97.6 +/- 48.1 microM in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that ATP-regulated K+ channels are activated by a smaller reduction in intracellular ATP in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. The differential ATP sensitivity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in endocardial and epicardial cells may be responsible for the differential shortening in action potentials during ischemia at the two sites.},

abstract = {Spatially discordant alternans, where the action potential duration (APD) and intracellular calcium transient (Ca(i)) alternate with opposite phase in different regions of tissue, is known to promote wave break and reentry. However, this phenomenon is not completely understood. It is known that alternans at the cellular level can be caused by dynamical instabilities arising from either membrane voltage (V(m)) attributable to steep APD restitution or to calcium (Ca) cycling. Here, we used a mathematical model of intracellular Ca cycling, coupled with membrane ion currents, to investigate the dynamics of V(m) and Ca(i) transient alternans in an isolated cell, in two electrotonically coupled cells, and in 1D spatially homogeneous tissue. Our main finding is a novel instability mechanism in which the bidirectional coupling of V(m) and Ca(i) can drive the Ca(i) transient of two neighboring cells to be out of phase. This instability is manifested in cardiac tissue by the dynamical formation of spatially discordant alternans. In this case, Ca(i) transient alternans can reverse phase over a length scale of one cell, whereas APD alternans reverses phase over a much longer length scale set by the electrotonic coupling. We analyze this mechanism in detail and show that it is a robust consequence of experimentally established properties of the bidirectional coupling between Ca cycling and V(m) dynamics. Finally, we address the experimental relevance of these findings and suggest physiological conditions under which these patterns can be observed.},

We have analyzed the kinetics of the early and late currents by recording whole cell and single-channel currents in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line (HEK293) expressing wild-type and KPQ deletion mutation in cardiac Na+ channels. The rate of inactivation increased three- to fivefold between -40 and -80 mV in the mutant channel. The rate of recovery from inactivation was increased twofold. Two modes of gating accounted for the late current: 1) isolated brief openings with open times that were weakly voltage dependent and the same as the initial transient and 2) bursts of opening with highly voltage-dependent prolonged open times. Latency to first opening was accelerated, suggesting an acceleration of the rate of activation. The delta KPQ mutation has multiple effects on activation and inactivation. The aggregate effects may account for the increased susceptibility to arrhythmias.},

Calcium influx and efflux were recorded continuously with 47Ca2+ and 45Ca2+. After 60 minutes of total ischemia and reperfusion for 30 minutes, there was a net calcium gain of 4.9 mmol/kg dry tissue. Verapamil given before total ischemia reduced net calcium gain to 1.5 mmol/kg dry tissue (n = 5, P less than 0.03). When given only on reperfusion after total ischemia, or 10 minutes before reperfusion during low flow ischemia, verapamil did not affect calcium exchange. Cardioplegia begun 10 minutes before total ischemia reduced net calcium gain to 1.0 +/- 0.26 mmol/kg dry tissue (n = 6, P less than 0.001). Cardioplegia during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion, or lack of electrical stimulation during reperfusion, did not reduce calcium gain. Net calcium gain correlated with the maximum rise in resting tension and with the recovery of developed tension. In control experiments neither verapamil nor cardioplegia altered influx or efflux of slowly exchanging calcium. The cardioprotective effects of cardioplegia and the calcium channel blocker verapamil appear to be due to a reduction of myocardial work rather than to any specific direct action on calcium fluxes across the myocardial cell membrane.},

abstract = {Beat-to-beat alternation in the cardiac intracellular Ca (Ca(i)) transient can drive action potential (AP) duration alternans, creating a highly arrhythmogenic substrate. Although a steep dependence of fractional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release on SR Ca load has been shown experimentally to promote Ca(i) alternans, theoretical studies predict that other factors are also important. Here we present an iterated map analysis of the coordinated effects of SR Ca release, uptake, and leak on the onset of Ca(i) alternans. Predictions were compared to numerical simulations using a physiologically realistic AP model as well as to AP clamp experiments in isolated patch-clamped rabbit ventricular myocytes exposed to 1), the Ca channel agonist BayK8644 (100 nM) to increase SR Ca load and release fraction, 2), overexpression of an adenoviral SERCA2a construct to increase SR Ca uptake, and 3), low-dose FK506 (20 microM) or ryanodine (1 microM) to increase SR Ca leak. Our findings show that SR Ca release, uptake, and leak all have independent direct effects that promote (release and leak) or suppress (uptake) Ca(i) alternans. However, since each factor affects the other by altering SR Ca load, the net balance of their direct and indirect effects determines whether they promote or suppress alternans. Thus, BayK8644 promotes, whereas Ad-SERCA2a overexpression, ryanodine, and FK506 suppress, Ca(i) alternans under AP clamp conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have favourable effects on haemodynamic measurements, neurohumoral activity, and left-ventricular remodelling when added to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We aimed to find out whether these drugs improve clinical outcome.

METHODS: Between March, 1999, and November, 1999, we enrolled 2548 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40\% or lower, and who were being treated with ACE inhibitors. We randomly assigned patients candesartan (n=1276, target dose 32 mg once daily) or placebo (n=1272). At baseline, 55\% of patients were also treated with beta blockers and 17\% with spironolactone. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat.

FINDINGS: The median follow-up was 41 months. 483 (38\%) patients in the candesartan group and 538 (42\%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.85 [95\% CI 0.75-0.96], p=0.011; covariate adjusted p=0.010). Candesartan reduced each of the components of the primary outcome significantly, as well as the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. The benefits of candesartan were similar in all predefined subgroups, including patients receiving baseline beta blocker treatment.

INTERPRETATION: The addition of candesartan to ACE inhibitor and other treatment leads to a further clinically important reduction in relevant cardiovascular events in patients with CHF and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Triggered beats during regional ischemia may depend upon the electrical source and sink charge interactions between adjacent regions of normal and ischemic cardiac tissue that are partly controlled by electrical coupling. METHODS: To study these relationships, we modified parameters in the Luo-Rudy dynamic membrane equations to reflect physiologic conditions associated with phase 1b arrhythmias. Superthreshold delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) formed after pacing. Coupling contributions were then examined using: (i) a single phase 1b myocyte connected via a variable resistance to a single normal myocyte, and (ii) a multicellular fiber with a 1-cm segment of phase 1b myocytes connected to a 1-cm normal segment having resistance changes that were confined to the ischemic segment. Integration of ionic, capacitive and coupling currents during DAD initiation allowed charge quantification. RESULTS: In cell pairs, phase 1b myocyte DADs were suppressed at resistances where normal myocyte pacing resulted in phase 1b myocyte excitation. Coupling charge requirements limited capacitive charging in the phase 1b myocyte, which occurred in combination with diastolic hyperpolarization that shifted transmembrane potential from threshold. In multicellular fiber simulations, DADs were suppressed with strong coupling in the phase 1b segment. Moderate uncoupling of that segment allowed superthreshold DAD formation away from the border that initiated action potential propagation in the normal segment. With severe uncoupling, propagation failed at the border. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the clinical and experimental observation that intermediate uncoupling is an important contributor to phase 1b arrhythmogenesis.},

abstract = {We extended the model of the ventricular myocyte by Winslow et al. (Circ. Res 1999, 84:571-586) by incorporating equations for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) buffering and transport by ATP and ADP and equations for MgATP regulation of ion transporters (Na(+)-K(+) pump, sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) pumps). The results indicate that, under normal conditions, Ca(2+) binding by low-affinity ATP and diffusion of CaATP may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The model also suggests that a fall in ATP/ADP ratio significantly reduces sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) content, increases diastolic Ca(2+), lowers systolic Ca(2+), increases Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels, and decreases the efficiency of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in extruding Ca(2+) during periodic voltage-clamp stimulation. The analysis suggests that the most important reason for these changes during metabolic inhibition is the down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase pump by reduced diastolic MgATP levels. High Ca(2+) concentrations developed near the membrane might have a greater influence on Mg(2+), ATP, and ADP concentrations than that of the lower Ca(2+) concentrations in the bulk myoplasm. The model predictions are in general agreement with experimental observations measured under normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract Two distinct delayed rectifier K+ currents, IKr and IKs, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier K+ current in the model was replaced by IKr and IKs. Our results show that IKs is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either IKr or IKs can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of IKr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, >80\% block of IKs results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high IKs-to-IKr density ratio (\{approx\}8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, IKr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of Iks to IKr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both IKr and IKs is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (ICa) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of IKr and IKs; it increases when the IKr-to-IKs density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i. This in turn causes different degrees of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICa and different degrees of Ca2+-dependent conductance of IKs at very long DIs (>5 s) for different BCLs. This BCL dependence of ICa and IKs that is secondary to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a "memory property" of cardiac cells.},

abstract = {Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While timely reperfusion of acutely ischaemic myocardium is essential for myocardial salvage, it leads to a unique type of injury known as 'myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury'. Growing evidence suggests that a defect in myocardial Ca(2+) transport system with cytosolic Ca(2+) overload is a major contributor to myocardial I/R injury. Progress in molecular genetics and medicine in past years has clearly demonstrated that modulation of Ca(2+) handling pathways in IHD could be cardioprotective. The potential benefits of these strategies in limiting I/R injury are vast, and the time is right for challenging in vivo systemic work both at pre-clinical and clinical levels.},

abstract = {We studied the individual and combined effects of extracellular acidosis and increases in extracellular potassium on action potential characteristics and conduction in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of acute ischemia. At each level of potassium between 2.7 and 17 mm, acidosis induced by increasing Pco2 (respiratory acidosis) and by decreasing HCO3- (metabolic acidosis) decreased resting membrane potential, the maximum rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (Vmax), and slowed conduction. Metabolic acidosis consistently and significantly lengthened the steady state action potential duration whereas respiratory acidosis did not. Respiratory acidosis caused changes in resting membrane potential, Vmax, and conduction velocity; which occurred more rapidly and were of greater magnitude than the changes induced by metabolic acidosis. The changes in Vmax induced both types of acidosis were due to a change in the resting membrane potential-Vmax relationship as well as to the changes in the resting membrane potential. The conduction slowing induced by acidosis was greater when potassium was 9 and 13 mM than when potassium was 5.4 mm. Our results suggest that acidosis causes important changes in the electrophysiological properties of ventricular fibers and that many of the known electrophysiological effects of acute ischemia can be mimicked by the combined effects of extracellular acidosis and an increase in extracellular potassium.},

abstract = {Long QT syndrome is a repolarization disorder characterized by marked prolongation of QT interval. A clear consequence of long QT syndrome is the occurrence of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia called Torsade de Pointes, which has been related to early after depolarizations (EADs) formation. This repolarizing disorder has been observed under pathological situations, such as heart failure, oxidative stress, ventricular hypertrophy and/or in the presence of pure class III antiarrhythmics. Under such pathologies electrophysiological changes affect the electrical activity of the cell. Lately, the enhancement of late sodium current (I(NaL)) and its role has become a source of interest. In this work, a mathematical model of I(NaL) has been proposed and incorporated to the ten Tussher model of the human ventricular action potential (AP), specifically in M cells. We simulated and analyzed the effects of I(NaL) enhancement in combination with LQT-related pathologies and administration of I(Kr) blockers, on the AP. This study demonstrates that I(NaL) prolongs AP duration (APD) in a rate-dependent manner. Indeed, a 10-fold increase of I(NaL) prolongs APD in 80\% for a stimulation rate of 1 Hz and 100\% for 0.25 Hz. Also, intracellular sodium concentration [Na(+)](i) significantly increases in the presence of enhanced I(NaL), increasing the probability of EADs formation through calcium overload in cells prone to develop EADs.},

abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

abstract = {The roles of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange in Ca2+ removal from cytosol were compared in isolated rabbit and rat ventricular myocytes during caffeine contractures and electrically stimulated twitches. Cell shortening and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were measured in indo-1-loaded cells. Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange was inhibited by replacement of external Na+ by Li+. To avoid net changes in cell or SR Ca2+ load during a twitch in 0 Na+ solution, intracellular Na+ (Na+i) was depleted using a long pre-perfusion with 0 Na+, 0 Ca2+ solution. SR Ca2+ accumulation was inhibited by caffeine or thapsigargin (TG). Relaxation of steady-state twitches was 2-fold faster in rat than in rabbit (before and after Na+i depletion). In contrast, caffeine contractures (where SR Ca2+ accumulation is inhibited), relaxed faster in rabbit cells. Removal of external Na+ increased the half-time for relaxation of caffeine contractures 15- and 5-fold in rabbit and rat myocytes respectively (and increased contracture amplitude in rabbit cells only). The time course of relaxation in 0 Na+, 0 Ca2+ solution was similar in the two species. Inhibition of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange during a twitch increased the [Ca2+]i transient amplitude (delta[Ca2+]i) by 50\% and the time constant of [Ca2+]i decline (tau) by 45\% in rabbit myocytes. A smaller increase in tau (20\%) and no change in delta[Ca2+]i were observed in rat cells in 0 Na+ solution. [Ca2+]i transients remained more rapid in rat cells. Inhibition of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase during a twitch enhanced delta[Ca2+]i by 25\% in both species. The increase in tau after TG exposure was greater in rat (9-fold) than in rabbit myocytes (2-fold), which caused [Ca2+]i decline to be 70\% slower in rat compared with rabbit cells. The time course of [Ca2+]i decline during twitch in TG-treated cells was similar to that during caffeine application in control cells. Combined inhibition of these Ca2+ transport systems markedly slowed the time course of [Ca2+]i decline, so that tau was virtually the same in both species and comparable to that during caffeine application in 0 Na+, 0 Ca2+ solution. Thus, the combined participation of slow Ca2+ transport mechanisms (mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and sarcolemmal Ca(2+)-ATPase) is similar in these species. We conclude that during the decline of the [Ca2+]i transient, the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange is about 2- to 3-fold faster in rabbit than in rat, whereas the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase is 2- to 3-fold faster in the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Cellular and ionic causes of variability in the electrophysiological activity of hearts from individuals of the same species are unknown. However, improved understanding of this variability is key to enable prediction of the response of specific hearts to disease and therapies. Limitations of current mathematical modeling and experimental techniques hamper our ability to provide insight into variability. Here, we describe a methodology to unravel the ionic determinants of intersubject variability exhibited in experimental recordings, based on the construction and calibration of populations of models. We illustrate the methodology through its application to rabbit Purkinje preparations, because of their importance in arrhythmias and safety pharmacology assessment. We consider a set of equations describing the biophysical processes underlying rabbit Purkinje electrophysiology, and we construct a population of over 10,000 models by randomly assigning specific parameter values corresponding to ionic current conductances and kinetics. We calibrate the model population by closely comparing simulation output and experimental recordings at three pacing frequencies. We show that 213 of the 10,000 candidate models are fully consistent with the experimental dataset. Ionic properties in the 213 models cover a wide range of values, including differences up to ±100\% in several conductances. Partial correlation analysis shows that particular combinations of ionic properties determine the precise shape, amplitude, and rate dependence of specific action potentials. Finally, we demonstrate that the population of models calibrated using data obtained under physiological conditions quantitatively predicts the action potential duration prolongation caused by exposure to four concentrations of the potassium channel blocker dofetilide.},

From investigations that dissect the process of ischemic damage into its constituent components, three principal components that pertain to electrophysiological changes have been identified: I. an increase in extracellular potassium concentration ([K],), 2. acidosis, and 3. hypoxia. To simulate ischemia we incorporated the effects of these principal ischemic conditions on the transmembrane currents and passive properties of the Luo- Rudy cell model. We studied the effects of simulated ischemia on the single cell and propagating action potential. As the simulated ischemic conditions are made more severe, resting membrane potentials depolarize, conduction velocity undergoes a non-monotonic increase then decrease towards block and (dV/dt)m,, plateaus intially and then declines towards block Action potential shortening, as occurs in myocardial ischemia, could be reproduced quantitatively by increased conductance of IK(ATP).},

abstract = {Differences in mRNA expression levels have been observed in failing versus non-failing human hearts for several membrane channel proteins and accessory subunits. These differences may play a causal role in electrophysiological changes observed in human heart failure and atrial fibrillation, such as action potential (AP) prolongation, increased AP triangulation, decreased intracellular calcium transient (CaT) magnitude and decreased CaT triangulation. Our goal is to investigate whether the information contained in mRNA measurements can be used to predict cardiac electrophysiological remodeling in heart failure using computational modeling. Using mRNA data recently obtained from failing and non-failing human hearts, we construct failing and non-failing cell populations incorporating natural variability and up/down regulation of channel conductivities. Six biomarkers are calculated for each cell in each population, at cycle lengths between 1500 ms and 300 ms. Regression analysis is performed to determine which ion channels drive biomarker variability in failing versus non-failing cardiomyocytes. Our models suggest that reported mRNA expression changes are consistent with AP prolongation, increased AP triangulation, increased CaT duration, decreased CaT triangulation and amplitude, and increased delay between AP and CaT upstrokes in the failing population. Regression analysis reveals that changes in AP biomarkers are driven primarily by reduction in I, and changes in CaT biomarkers are driven predominantly by reduction in I and SERCA. In particular, the role of I is pacing rate dependent. Additionally, alternans developed at fast pacing rates for both failing and non-failing cardiomyocytes, but the underlying mechanisms are different in control and heart failure.},

abstract = {Computational modelling and simulation, in close interaction with exper- iments, has provided invaluable insight into the biochemical, mechanical and electrophysiological function and dysfunction of the heart. However, limitations in imaging techniques and computing resources have precluded the analysis of tissue architecture near the cellular scale and the effect of this architecture on cardiac function. It is the wider aim of this thesis to develop a framework to investigate the role of microstructure in cardiac propagation dynamics and arrhythmoge- nesis. An initial modelling study elucidates the effect of blood vessels in sustaining arrhythmic episodes, and how the accurate modelling of fibre direction in the vicinity of the vessels mitigates this detrimental mecha- nism. A mathematical model of fibre orientation in a simple geometry around blood vessels has been developed, based on information obtained from highly detailed histological and MRI datasets. A simulation regime was chosen, guided by the vasculature extracted from whole heart MRI images, to analyse ventricular wavefront propagation for different orienta- tions and positions of blood vessels. Our results demonstrate not only that the presence of the blood vessels encourages curvature in the activation wavefront around the blood vessels, but further that vessels act to restrict and prolong phase singularities. When compared to a more simplistic im- plementation of fibre orientation, the model is shown to weaken wavefront curvature and reduce phase singularity anchoring. Having established the importance of microstructural detail in computational models, it seems ex- pedient to generate accurate data in this regard. The first steps have been taken merging MRI and histological images, in order to present the first 3-D sub-cellular resolution images of cardiac tissue, segmented by tissue type. Models including this detail will be developed and simulation will yield a deeper understanding of the role of microstructure in arrhythmia.},

abstract = {A number of gender differences exist in the human electrocardiogram (ECG): the P-wave and P-R intervals are slightly longer in men than in women, whilst women have higher resting heart rates than do men, but a longer rate-corrected QT (QT(C)) interval. Women with the LQT1 and LQT2 variants of congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) are at greater risk of adverse cardiac events. Similarly, many drugs associated with acquired LQTS have a greater risk of inducing torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia in women than in men. There are also male:female differences in Brugada syndrome, early repolarisation syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The differences in the ECG between men and women, and in particular those relating to the QT interval, have been explored experimentally and provide evidence of differences in the processes underlying ventricular repolarization. The data available from rabbit, canine, rat, mouse and guinea pig models are reviewed and highlight involvement of male:female differences in Ca and K currents, although the possible involvement of rapid and persistent Na current and Na-Ca exchange currents cannot yet be excluded. The mechanisms underlying observed differences remain to be elucidated fully, but are likely to involve the influence of gonadal steroids. With respect to the QT interval and risk of TdP, a range of evidence implicates a protective role of testosterone in male hearts, possibly by both genomic and non-genomic pathways. Evidence regarding oestrogen and progesterone is less unequivocal, although the interplay between these two hormones may influence both repolarization and pro-arrhythmic risk.},

@article{Franzini-Armstrong1999,
abstract = {Excitation contraction (e-c) coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscles involves an interaction between specialized junctional domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and of exterior membranes (either surface membrane or transverse (T) tubules). This interaction occurs at special structures named calcium release units (CRUs). CRUs contain two proteins essential to e-c coupling: dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), L-type Ca(2+) channels of exterior membranes; and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the Ca(2+) release channels of the SR. Special CRUs in cardiac muscle are constituted by SR domains bearing RyRs that are not associated with exterior membranes (the corbular and extended junctional SR or EjSR). Functional groupings of RyRs and DHPRs within calcium release units have been named couplons, and the term is also loosely applied to the EjSR of cardiac muscle. Knowledge of the structure, geometry, and disposition of couplons is essential to understand the mechanism of Ca(2+) release during muscle activation. This paper presents a compilation of quantitative data on couplons in a variety of skeletal and cardiac muscles, which is useful in modeling calcium release events, both macroscopic and microscopic ("sparks").},

abstract = {Despite the strong association between mechanical dysfunction of the heart and sudden death due to arrhythmias, the causal relationship is not well understood. Cardiac alternans has been linked to arrhythmogenesis and can be mediated by intracellular calcium handling. Given the integral role intracellular calcium plays in contractile function, calcium-mediated alternans may represent an important mechanistic link between mechanical dysfunction and electrical instability. This relationship, however, is not well understood due to complex feedback between membrane currents, intracellular calcium, and contraction. This manuscript describes the cellular mechanisms of cardiac alternans. Through several pathways, calcium transient alternans is coupled to repolarization alternans that can form a substrate for reentrant excitation. Abnormal intracellular calcium cycling, either impaired release or impaired reuptake of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, is a cellular mechanism of calcium transient alternans. Thus, cardiac alternans is an important mechanistic link between mechanical dysfunction and sudden cardiac death.},

We performed multiscale molecular dynamics and continuum electrostatics calculations to simulate a cardiac K(+) channel (I(Ks)) gating and its alteration by mutations that cause arrhythmias and sudden death. An all-atom model of the I(Ks) alpha-subunit KCNQ1, based on the recent Kv1.2 structure, is used to calculate electrostatic energies during gating. Simulations are compared with experiments where varying degrees of positive charge-added via point mutation-progressively reduce current. Whole-cell simulations show that mutations cause action potential and ECG QT interval prolongation, consistent with clinical phenotypes. This framework allows integration of multiscale observations to study the molecular basis of excitation and its alteration by disease.},

abstract = {Influx of Ca2+ into myocytes via Na+/Ca2+ exchange may be stimulated by the high levels of intracellular Na+ and the changes in membrane potential known to occur during ischemia/reperfusion. This increased influx could, in turn, lead to Ca2+ overload and injury. Overexpression of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger therefore may increase susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury. To test this hypothesis, the hearts of male and female transgenic mice, overexpressing the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein, and hearts of their wild-type littermates, were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and subjected to 20 minutes of ischemia and 40 minutes of reperfusion. Preischemic left ventricular developed pressures and +dP/dtmax, as well as -dP/dtmin, were higher in the male transgenic hearts compared with wild-type, implying a role for Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the contraction, as well as the relaxation, phases of the cardiac beat. Postischemic function was lower in male transgenic than in male wild-type hearts (7+/-2\% versus 32+/-6\% of preischemic function), but there was no difference between female transgenic and female wild-type hearts, both at approximately 30\% of preischemic function. To assess whether this male/female difference was due to female-specific hormones such as estrogen, the hearts of bilaterally ovariectomized and sham-operated transgenic females were subjected to the same protocol. The functional recoveries of ovariectomized female transgenic hearts were lower (17+/-3\% of preischemic function) than those of wild-type and sham-operated transgenic females. The lower postischemic functional recovery in the male transgenic and female ovariectomized transgenic hearts correlated with lower recoveries of the energy metabolites, ATP and phosphocreatine, as measured by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Alternans were observed during reperfusion in male transgenic and female ovariectomized transgenic hearts only, consistent with intracellular Ca2+ overload. Western analyses showed that alterations in the expression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange or L-type Ca2+ channel proteins were not responsible for the protection observed in the female transgenic hearts. In conclusion, in males, overexpression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger reduced postischemic recovery of both contractile function and energy metabolites, indicating that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may play a role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. From the studies of females, however, it appears that this exacerbation of ischemia/reperfusion injury by overexpression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger can be overcome partially by female-specific hormones such as estrogen.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

abstract = {T-wave alternans is considered a potentially useful clinical marker for the risk of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with heart disease. Cellular repolarisation alternans is thought to underlie T-wave alternans, and moreover, to cause re-entrant ventricular arrhythmia. This review examines the experimental and clinical evidence linking repolarisation alternans and T-wave alternans with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Repolarisation alternans, manifest as alternating changes in action potential duration, is observed in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes and in multicellular preparations. Its underlying causes are discussed particularly with respect to the role of intracellular Ca(2+). The repolarisation alternans observed at the single cell level is compared to the alternating behaviour observed in isolated multicellular preparations including the perfused ventricular wedge and Langendorff perfused heart. The evidence concerning spatial differences in repolarisation alternans is considered, particularly the situation where adjacent regions of myocardium exhibit repolarisation alternans of different phases. This extreme behaviour, known as discordant alternans, is thought to produce marked gradients of repolarisation that can precipitate unidirectional block and re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias. Finally, the difficulties in extrapolating between experimental models of alternans and arrhythmias and the clinical manifestation are discussed. The areas where experimental evidence is weak are highlighted, and areas for future research are outlined.},

No significant change in the concentration of these cations was noted in permanently ischemic, irreversibly injured myocardial cells, but tissue calcium was markedly increased in cells killed by an episode of transient ischemia. Tissue water and sodium also were increased and magnesium was decreased significantly in the transient ischemia model. Investigation of the localization of the increased Ca(--) by cellular fractionation and chemical analysis as well as by electron miscroscopy and microincineration showed that much of it was localized in dense bodies within the mitochondria.

abstract = {Cardiac alternans are thought to be a precursor to life-threatening arrhythmias. Previous studies suggested that alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content are either causative or not associated with myocyte Ca2+ alternans. However, those studies used indirect measures of SR Ca2+. Here we used direct continuous measurement of intra-SR free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]SR) (using Fluo5N) during frequency-dependent Ca2+ alternans in rabbit ventricular myocytes. We tested the hypothesis that alternating [Ca2+]SR is required for Ca2+ alternans. Amplitudes of [Ca2+]SR depletions alternated in phase with cytosolic Ca2+ transients and contractions. Some cells showed clear alternation in diastolic [Ca2+]SR during alternans, with higher [Ca2+]SR before the larger SR Ca2+ releases. However, the extent of SR Ca2+ release during the small beats was smaller than expected for the modest decrease in [Ca2+]SR. In other cells, clear Ca2+ alternans was observed without alternations in diastolic [Ca2+]SR. Additionally, alternating cells were observed, in which diastolic [Ca2+]SR fluctuations occurred interspersed by depletions in which the amplitude was unrelated to the preceding diastolic [Ca2+]SR. In all forms of alternans, the SR Ca2+ release rate was higher during large depletions than during small depletions. Although [Ca2+]SR exerts major influence on SR Ca2+ release, alternations in [Ca2+](SR) are not required for Ca2+ alternans to occur. Rather, it seems likely that some other factor, such as ryanodine receptor availability after a prior beat (eg, recovery from inactivation), is of greater importance in initiating frequency-induced Ca2+ alternans. However, once such a weak SR Ca2+ release occurs, it can result in increased [Ca2+]SR and further enhance SR Ca2+ release at the next beat. In this way, diastolic [Ca2+]SR alternans can enhance frequency-induced Ca2+ alternans, even if they initiate by other means.},

In lateral pyloric (LP) neurons, we saw strong correlations between measured current and the abundance of Shal and BK-KCa mRNAs (encoding the Shal-family voltage-gated potassium channel and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, respectively). We also saw two- to fourfold interanimal variability for three potassium currents and their mRNA expression. Measurements of channel expression in the two electrically coupled pyloric dilator (PD) neurons showed significant interanimal variability, but copy numbers for IH (encoding the hyperpolarization-activated, inward-current channel) and Shal mRNA in the two PD neurons from the same crab were similar, suggesting that the regulation of some currents may be shared in electrically coupled neurons.},

This review discusses these new tools and how their application to the problem of arrhythmias is generating new mechanistic insights to identify patients at risk for this condition and developing improved antiarrhythmic therapies.},

abstract = {1. The relative contributions of the rapid and slow components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr and IKs, respectively) to dog cardiac action potential configuration were compared in ventricular myocytes and in multicellular right ventricular papillary muscle and Purkinje fibre preparations. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, conventional microelectrode and in vivo ECG measurements were made at 37C. 2. Action potential duration (APD) was minimally increased (less than 7\%) by chromanol 293B (10 microM) and L-735,821 (100 nM), selective blockers of IKs, over a range of pacing cycle lengths (300-5000 ms) in both dog right ventricular papillary muscles and Purkinje fibre strands. D-Sotalol (30 microM) and E-4031 (1 microM), selective blockers of IKr, in the same preparations markedly (20-80\%) lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. 3. In vivo ECG recordings in intact anaesthetized dogs indicated no significant chromanol 293B (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) effect on the QTc interval (332.9 +/- 16.1 ms before versus 330.5 +/- 11.2 ms, n = 6, after chromanol 293B), while D-sotalol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) significantly increased the QTc interval (323.9 +/- 7.3 ms before versus 346.5 +/- 6.4 ms, n = 5, after D-sotalol, P < 0.05). 4. The current density estimated during the normal ventricular muscle action potential (i.e. after a 200 ms square pulse to +30 mV or during a 250 ms long 'action potential-like' test pulse) indicates that substantially more current is conducted through IKr channels than through IKs channels. However, if the duration of the square test pulse or the 'action potential-like' test pulse was lengthened to 500 ms the relative contribution of IKs significantly increased. 5. When APD was pharmacologically prolonged in papillary muscle (1 microM E-4031 and 1 microg ml-1 veratrine), 100 nM L-735,821 and 10 microM chromanol 293B lengthened repolarization substantially by 14.4 +/- 3.4 and 18. 0 +/- 3.4\% (n = 8), respectively. 6. We conclude that in this study IKs plays little role in normal dog ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibre action potential repolarization and that IKr is the major source of outward current responsible for initiation of final action potential repolarization. Thus, when APD is abnormally increased, the role of IKs in final repolarization increases to provide an important safety mechanism that reduces arrhythmia risk.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes a new semiphysiological ionic model, used recently to study reexitations and reentry in cardiac tissue [I.R. Cantalapiedra et al, PRE 82 011907 (2010)]. The aim of the model is to reproduce action potencial morphologies and restitution curves obtained, either from experimental data, or from more complex electrophysiological models. The model divides all ion currents into four groups according to their function, thus resulting into fast-slow and inward-outward currents. We show that this simplified model is flexible enough as to accurately capture the electrical properties of cardiac myocytes, having the advantage of being less computational demanding than detailed electrophysiological models. Under some conditions, it has been shown to be amenable to mathematical analysis. The model reproduces the action potential (AP) change with stimulation rate observed both experimentally and in realistic models of healthy human and guinea pig myocytes (TNNP and LRd models, respectively). When simulated in a cable it also gives the right dependence of the conduction velocity (CV) with stimulation rate. Besides reproducing correctly these restitution properties, it also gives a good fit for the morphology of the AP, including the notch typical of phase 1. Finally, we perform simulations in a realistic geometric model of the rabbit's ventricles, finding a good qualitative agreement in AP propagation and the ECG. Thus, this simplified model represents an alternative to more complex models when studying instabilities in wave propagation.},

abstract = {The ventricular tissue is activated in a stochastic rather than in a deterministic rhythm due to the inherent heart rate variability (HRV). Low HRV is a known predictor for arrhythmia events and traditionally is attributed to autonomic nervous system tone damage. Yet, there is no model that directly assesses the antiarrhythmic effect of pacing stochasticity per se. One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) human ventricular tissues were modeled, and both deterministic and stochastic pacing protocols were applied. Action potential duration restitution (APDR) and conduction velocity restitution (CVR) curves were generated and analyzed, and the propensity and characteristics of action potential duration (APD) alternans were investigated. In the 1D model, pacing stochasticity was found to sustain a moderating effect on the APDR curve by reducing its slope, rendering the tissue less arrhythmogenic. Moreover, stochasticity was found to be a significant antagonist to the development of concordant APD alternans. These effects were generally amplified with increased variability in the pacing cycle intervals. In addition, in the 2D tissue configuration, stochastic pacing exerted a protective antiarrhythmic effect by reducing the spatial APD heterogeneity and converting discordant APD alternans to concordant ones. These results suggest that high cardiac pacing stochasticity is likely to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients.},

abstract = {Isochronal maps of ventricular activation were analyzed in dogs 3-5 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery utilizing a 64-channel multiplexer. Isochronal maps of the effective refractory period were determined from 62 epicardial sites and correlated with the activation maps. The ischemia occurring in the surviving epicardial layer prolonged refractoriness in a spatially nonuniform manner. The resulting pattern of refractoriness on the epicardial surface resembled concentric rings of isorefractoriness which increased in duration from the normal zone to the center of the ischemic zone. The formation of an arc of functional unidirectional conduction block occurred along the gradient of refractoriness and the exact location of the arc depended on the S1-S2 interval. When a short S1-S2 failed to induce reentry, fewer adjacent sites with sufficiently disparate refractoriness formed a smaller arc of block. A subsequent S3 encountered further nonuniformly shortened refractoriness (normal areas had shortened refractoriness greater than ischemic areas) and the arc of block was lengthened. This required a longer time for the wavefront to circulate around the arc. When it then reached the distal side of the arc, refractoriness had expired proximal to the arc and reentry occurred. Similarly, nonuniform shortening of refractoriness explained why one reentrant beat may or may not produce successive reentrant beats. Therefore, the spatial pattern of refractoriness forms the substrate for the arc of unidirectional conduction block that is fundamental to the development of ventricular reentry in this experimental model.},

abstract = {Sex-based differences in human susceptibility to cardiac ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely result from the emergent effects of multiple intersecting processes that fundamentally differ in male and female hearts. Included are measured differences in the genes encoding key cardiac ion channels and effects of sex steroid hormones to acutely modify electrical activity. At the genome-scale, human females have recently been shown to have lower expression of genes encoding key cardiac repolarizing potassium currents and connexin43, the primary ventricular gap-junction subunit. Human males and females also have distinct sex steroid hormones. Here, we developed mathematical models for male and female ventricular human heart cells by incorporating experimentally determined genomic differences and effects of sex steroid hormones into the O'Hara-Rudy model. These "male" and "female" model cells and tissues then were used to predict how various sex-based differences underlie arrhythmia risk. Genomic-based differences in ion channel expression were alone sufficient to determine longer female cardiac action potential durations (APD) in both epicardial and endocardial cells compared to males. Subsequent addition of sex steroid hormones exacerbated these differences, as testosterone further shortened APDs, while estrogen and progesterone application resulted in disparate effects on APDs. Our results indicate that incorporation of experimentally determined genomic differences from human hearts in conjunction with sex steroid hormones are consistent with clinically observed differences in QT interval, T-wave shape and morphology, and critically, in the higher vulnerability of adult human females to Torsades de Pointes type arrhythmias. The model suggests that female susceptibility to alternans stems from longer female action potentials, while reentrant arrhythmia derives largely from sex-based differences in conduction play an important role in arrhythmia vulnerability.},

abstract = {Management strategies for ventricular arrhythmias are guided by the risk of sudden death and severity of symptoms. Patients with a substantial risk of sudden death usually need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Although ICDs effectively end most episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and decrease mortality in specific populations of patients, they have inherent risks and limitations. Generally, antiarrhythmic drugs do not provide sufficient protection from sudden death, but do have a role in reducing arrhythmias that cause symptoms. Catheter ablation is likewise important for reducing the frequency of spontaneous arrhythmias and is curative for some patients, usually those with idiopathic arrhythmias and no heart disease. Arrhythmia surgery is now infrequent, offered by only a few specialised centres for refractory arrhythmias. Advances in understanding of genetic arrhythmia syndromes and in technology for mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias, and enhanced algorithms in implantable devices for rhythm management, have contributed to improved outcomes.},

abstract = {In isolated adult rat myocytes, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic inhibition and simulated ischemia regulate the NADH/NAD+ redox couple with concomitant impairment of energy-dependent process, including contraction and maintenance of high-energy phosphate stores. We developed a method to examine the relationship among the redox couple, ATP content, and contractile performance in single cells under several conditions analogous to myocardial ischemia, with and without reperfusion. Myocytes were paced at 1 Hz while cell contraction and NADH fluorescence were determined simultaneously for single cells at 37 degrees C. Cells were exposed to cyanide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (metabolic inhibition) or to metabolic inhibition plus 12 mM KCl and 20 mM lactate at pH 6.5 (simulated ischemia). Pyridine nucleotide fluorescence signals from single cells studied in this fashion could be modulated by metabolic inhibitors in a manner similar to that classically described for isolated mitochondria. Metabolic inhibition or simulated ischemia quickly produced maximal reduction of NAD+ to NADH. When cells were exposed to simulated ischemia for 10 min, then superfused with glucose-containing control buffer, 28\% of cells exposed to conditions of simulated ischemia developed hypercontracture on reperfusion. Hypercontracture developed despite mitochondrial electron transport being reestablished. When myocyte suspensions in a cuvette were studied spectrofluorimetrically, the pyridine nucleotide fluorescence response to metabolic inhibitors was similar to that for a single cell. This permitted correlation of ATP determinations on cells in suspension with contractile and fluorescence measurements from single myocytes. In the absence of glycolysis there is correspondence among loss of electron transport, decline in high-energy phosphate concentration, and decline in contraction. Irreversible disruption of the electron transport process does not appear to be an early event in ischemic injury.},

The voltage dependence of the steady-state open probability indicated that the activation process involves the movement of the equivalent of 12-16 electronic charges across the membrane. The sigmoidal kinetics of the activation process, which is maintained at depolarized voltages up to at least +100 mV indicate the presence of at least five sequential conformational changes before opening. The voltage dependence of the gating charge movement suggested that each elementary transition involves 3.5 electronic charges. The voltage dependence of the forward opening rate, as estimated by the single-channel first latency distribution, the final phase of the macroscopic ionic current activation, the ionic current reactivation and the ON gating current time course, showed movement of the equivalent of 0.3 to 0.5 electronic charges were associated with a large number of the activation transitions. The equivalent charge movement of 1.1 electronic charges was associated with the closing conformational change. The results were generally consistent with models involving a number of independent and identical transitions with a major exception that the first closing transition is slower than expected as indicated by tail current and OFF gating charge measurements.},

A significant heart rate increase was obtained after potassium decrease and calcium and pH increase, with no significant variations in indices of autonomic activity. Model-based computer simulations were then used to separate the effects of each ionic species and pH on sinus node cell pacemaker activity. This analysis revealed that changes in physiological range of potassium, calcium, and pH could cause large heart rate variations from 60 to 90 bpm. Nonlinear heart rate dependence on potassium was also recognized. It was concluded that electrolyte and pH changes in physiological range have an important, complex, impact on the pacemaking rhythm independently of autonomic outflow.},

Recent reports in animal experiments have indicated an opposite characteristics of the vulnerability in normal and ischemic transmural tissues. In order to clarify the differences and to investigate the mechanisms, a computer simulation method was used in this study to investigate the vulnerability relative to the premature pacing sites in normal and ischemic transmural tissues. Endo-, mid- and epi-cardial myocytes incorporating different severities of ischemia were developed across a tissue strand. The sodium channel inactivation gating variable h was calculated to provide the degree of sodium current recovery preceding the premature pacing. In the normal tissue, the measured vulnerable window was demonstrated to be wider by delivering an endocardial premature beat than that by applying an epicardial premature pacing. On the contrary, during ischemia the epicardium showed a wider vulnerable window than the endocardium. The results illustrated that during ischemia h decreased with accumulation of [K⁺]o, and action potential duration dispersion was obviously altered due to anoxia. In contrast, the elevated [K⁺]o was suggested to play an important role in the difference of the location-dependent vulnerability in normal and ischemic tissues.},

abstract = {We present a mathematical model of calcium cycling that takes into account the spatially localized nature of release events that correspond to experimentally observed calcium sparks. This model naturally incorporates graded release by making the rate at which calcium sparks are recruited proportional to the whole cell L-type calcium current, with the total release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) being just the sum of local releases. The dynamics of calcium cycling is studied by pacing the model with a clamped action potential waveform. Experimentally observed calcium alternans are obtained at high pacing rates. The results show that the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is a steep nonlinear dependence of the calcium released from the SR on the diastolic SR calcium concentration (SR load) and/or the diastolic calcium level in the cytosol, where the dependence on diastolic calcium is due to calcium-induced inactivation of the L-type calcium current. In addition, the results reveal that the calcium dynamics can become chaotic even though the voltage pacing is periodic. We reduce the equations of the model to a two-dimensional discrete map that relates the SR and cytosolic concentrations at one beat and the previous beat. From this map, we obtain a condition for the onset of calcium alternans in terms of the slopes of the release-versus-SR load and release-versus-diastolic-calcium curves. From an analysis of this map, we also obtain an understanding of the origin of chaotic dynamics.},

abstract = {The ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels are pivotal to signal transduction and cell function in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes. In this paper a kinetic model is proposed for these channels. In the model there are two Ca regulatory sites on the channel protein, one positive and the other negative. Cytoplasmic Ca binds to these regulatory sites independently It is assumed that the binding of Ca to the positive site is a much faster process than binding to the negative site. At steady state, the channel opening as a function of the Ca concentration is a bell-shaped curve. The model predicts the adaptation of channels to constant Ca stimulus. When this model is applied to cardiac myocytes, it predicts excitability with respect to Ca perturbations, smoothly graded responses, and Ca oscillations in certain pathological circumstances. In a spatially distributed system, traveling Ca waves in individual myocytes exist under certain conditions. This model can also be applied to other systems where the ryanodine-sensitive channels have been identified.},

abstract = {Computer simulations and nonlinear dynamics have provided invaluable tools for illuminating the underlying mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we review how this approach has led to major insights into the mechanisms of spatially discordant alternans, a key arrhythmogenic factor predisposing the heart to re-entry and lethal arrhythmias. During spatially discordant alternans, the action potential duration (APD) alternates out of phase in different regions of the heart, markedly enhancing dispersion of refractoriness so that ectopic beats have a high probability of inducing reentry. We show how, at the cellular level, instabilities in membrane voltage (ie, steep APD restitution slope) and intracellular Ca (Cai) cycling dynamics cause APD and the Cai transient to alternate and how the characteristics of alternans are affected by different "modes" of the bidirectional coupling between voltage and Cai. We illustrate how, at the tissue level, additional factors, such as conduction velocity restitution and ectopic beats, promote spatially discordant alternans. These insights have illuminated the mechanistic basis underlying the clinical association of cardiac alternans (eg, T wave alternans) with arrhythmia risk, which may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to avert sudden cardiac death.},

@article{Henderson2004,
abstract = {The excitation-contraction coupling cycle in cardiac muscle is initiated by an influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx induces a release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myocyte contraction. To maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, Ca2+ entry is balanced by efflux mediated by the sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. In the absence of Na+-Ca2+ exchange, it would be expected that cardiac myocytes would overload with Ca2+. Using Cre/loxP technology, we generated mice with a cardiac-specific knockout of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1. The exchanger is completely ablated in 80\% to 90\% of the cardiomyocytes as determined by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and exchange function. Surprisingly, the NCX1 knockout mice live to adulthood with only modestly reduced cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography. At 7.5 weeks of age, measures of contractility are decreased by 20\% to 30\%. We detect no adaptation of the myocardium to the absence of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger as measured by both immunoblots and microarray analysis. Ca2+ transients of isolated myocytes from knockout mice display normal magnitudes and relaxation kinetics and normal responses to isoproterenol. Under voltage clamp conditions, the current through L-type Ca2+ channels is reduced by 50\%, although the number of channels is unchanged. An abbreviated action potential may further reduce Ca2+ influx. Rather than upregulate other Ca2+ efflux mechanisms, the myocardium appears to functionally adapt to the absence of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger by limiting Ca2+ influx. The magnitude of Ca2+ transients appears to be maintained by an increased gain of sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ release. The myocardium of the NCX1 knockout mice undergoes a remarkable adaptation to maintain near normal cardiac function.},

abstract = {To determine the contribution of transsarcolemmal calcium flux to abnormal diastolic function produced by brief periods of flow-limiting ischemia and reperfusion, we evaluated early and late diastolic function during transient coronary occlusion and reperfusion before and during administration of intravenous nifedipine (NIF) (10 +/- 1 microgram/kg/min) in nine preinstrumented conscious dogs. We also assessed the effects of nitroprusside (NTP) (2 +/- 0.2 micrograms/kg/min) during an identical period of ischemia and reperfusion to independently assess the consequences of altered loading alone on diastolic function. To minimize the effects of temporal dysynchrony and altered ventricular loading conditions on isovolumetric relaxation, we developed a conscious dog preparation of reversible transient (30 to 60 sec) bilateral coronary occlusion (BCO). BCO was characterized by significant systolic depression: maximum (+)dP/dt decreased (from 2617 +/- 600 to 1981 +/- 565 mm Hg/sec, p less than .05), left ventricular transverse dimension shortening diminished (from 20 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 5\%, p less than .05), and the left ventricle dilated (42.4 +/- 6.4 to 43.8 +/- 6.3 mm, p less than .05). Concomitantly the time constants of isovolumetric relaxation prolonged (from 22 +/- 3 to 28 +/- 4 msec, p less than .05) and minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure increased (from -3 +/- 6 to 6 +/-6 mm Hg, p less than .05). The passive diastolic pressure-dimension relationship shifted upward and to the right and was associated with increased chamber stiffness (from 0.50 +/- 0.26 to 1.03 +/- 0.53 mm Hg/mm, p less than .05) and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 7 +/- 7 to 19 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than .05). Reperfusion immediately after BCO was characterized by prompt restoration of systolic contractile performance [maximum (+)dP/dt 3220 +/- 530 mm Hg/sec] but persistently abnormal early and late diastolic function (time constant of isovolumetric relaxation 30 +/- 6 msec, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 +/- 7 mm Hg). The effects of drug administration on ventricular function during BCO were then evaluated under matched loading conditions. NTP improved time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (20 +/- 8 vs 28 +/- 4 msec, p less than .05) and minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure (2 +/- 5 vs 6 +/- mm Hg, p less than .05) during BCO, but NIF did not (time constant of isovolumetric relaxation 27 +/- 6 msec, minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure 7 +/- 5 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {To clarify conflicting reports concerning the effects of ischemia on left ventricular chamber stiffness, we compared the effects of hypoxia at constant coronary perfusion with those of global ischemia on left ventricular diastolic chamber stiffness using isolated, perfused rabbit hearts in which the left ventricle was contracting isovolumically. Since chamber volume was held constant, increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) reflected increases in chamber stiffness. At a control coronary flow rate (30 ml/min), 2 min of hypoxia and pacing tachycardia (4.0 Hz) produced major increases in postpacing LVEDP (10+/-1 to 24+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and the relaxation time constant, T, (40+/-4 to 224+/-37 ms, P < 0.001), while percent lactate extraction ratio became negative (+ 18+/-2 to -48+/-15\%, P < 0.001). Coronary perfusion pressure decreased (72+/-5 to 52+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01), and since coronary flow was held constant, the fall in coronary perfusion pressure reflected coronary dilation and a decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Following an average of 71+/-6s reoxygenation and initial heart rate (2.0 Hz), LVEDP and relaxation time constant T returned to control. Hypoxia alone (without pacing tachycardia) produced similar although less marked changes (LVEDP, 10+/-1 to 20+/-3 mm Hg; and T, 32+/-3 to 119+/-22 ms; P < 0.01 for both) and there was a strong correlation between LVEDP and T (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). When a similar degree of coronary vasodilatation was induced with adenosine, no change in LVEDP occurred, indicating that the increase in end diastolic pressure observed during hypoxia was not secondary to vascular engorgement, but due to an acute effect of hypoxia on the diastolic behavior of the ventricular myocardium. In contrast, global ischemia produced by low coronary flow (12-15 ml/min) resulted in a decrease in LVEDP, as well as a marked fall in left ventricular systolic pressure. In 14 global ischemia experiments, pacing tachycardia led to a further decline in left ventricular systolic pressure, and no increase was noted in postpacing LVEDP. Changes in lactate extraction ratio were much smaller in magnitude than with hypoxia and constant coronary perfusion. In two experiments (one at normal coronary flow and one at 15 ml/min), left ventricular systolic pressure did not change markedly from control when tachycardia was superimposed, and postpacing LVEDP showed a marked rise (to > 25 mm Hg), which gradually recovered over 1-2 min at the control heart rate. From these results, we conclude that left ventricular chamber stiffness increases when myocardial O(2) demand exceeds supply. This change is usually masked in ischemic (reduced coronary flow) preparations, perhaps because of reduced turgor of the coronary vascular bed, marked reductions in systolic work (and therefore myocardial O(2) requirements), and local accumulation of hydrogen ion and metabolites following acute severe reduction of coronary flow. The increased chamber stiffness during hypoxia is accompanied by marked slowing of relaxation, with increased diastolic pressure relative to volume persisting throughout diastole.},

@article{Silverman1991,
abstract = {Single, isolated rat ventricular myocytes were made hypoxic for 10 minutes and then reoxygenated. During hypoxia, there was a marked abbreviation of the mechanical twitch, without a decrease in its amplitude. Immediately after reoxygenation, both the time to peak shortening and the duration of relaxation were markedly prolonged, and they remained prolonged for 10-50 minutes. The alterations in contraction and relaxation were not associated with any change in the time course of either the transmembrane action potential or the cytosolic calcium transient, as recorded with the fluorescent probe indo 1. Intracellular pH, measured with a fluorescent probe (carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor), showed an acid shift during hypoxia and an alkaline rebound immediately after reoxygenation. The time courses of intracellular pH and contraction duration were not parallel during hypoxia or reoxygenation, and simulation of the alkaline pH shift by lowering PCO2 or superfusing NH4Cl (in the absence of exposure to hypoxia) did not quantitatively reproduce the prolongation of relaxation seen after reoxygenation. The prolongation of contraction after reoxygenation could be overridden by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the nonenzymatic phosphatase butanedione monoxime. We conclude that delayed relaxation after reoxygenation exists at the single cell level and is due to an alteration of the properties of the myofilaments. Intracellular pH is not the primary mediator of this alteration. We speculate that alteration of intracellular inorganic phosphate or covalent modification of the myofilaments might be involved.},

Quantitative adjustment of such models to experimental data (personalization) is needed in order to test their realism and predictive power, but it remains challenging at the organ scale. In this paper, we propose a framework for the personalization of a 3-D cardiac EP model, the Mitchell-Schaeffer (MS) model, and evaluate its volumetric predictive power under various pacing scenarios. The personalization was performed on ex vivo large porcine healthy hearts using diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) and optical mapping data. The MS model was simulated on a 3-D mesh incorporating local fiber orientations, built from DT-MRI. The 3-D model parameters were optimized using features such as 2-D epicardial depolarization and repolarization maps, extracted from the optical mapping. We also evaluated the sensitivity of our personalization framework to different pacing locations and showed results on its robustness. Further, we evaluated volumetric model predictions for various epi- and endocardial pacing scenarios. We demonstrated promising results with a mean personalization error around 5 ms and a mean prediction error around 10 ms (5\% of the total depolarization time). Finally, we discussed the potential translation of such work to clinical data and pathological hearts.},

To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification.},

abstract = {During acute myocardial ischemia, reentrant episodes may lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF), giving rise to potentially mortal arrhythmias. VF has been traditionally related to dispersion of refractoriness and more recently to the source-sink relationship. Our goal is to theoretically investigate the relative role of dispersion of refractoriness and source-sink mismatch in vulnerability to reentry in the specific situation of regional myocardial acute ischemia. The electrical activity of a regionally ischemic tissue was simulated using a modified version of the Luo-Rudy dynamic model. Ischemic conditions were varied to simulate the time-course of acute ischemia. Our results showed that dispersion of refractoriness increased with the severity of ischemia. However, no correlation between dispersion of refractoriness and the width of the vulnerable window was found. Additionally, in approximately 50\% of the reentries, unidirectional block (UDB) took place in cells completely recovered from refractoriness. We examined patterns of activation after premature stimulation and they were intimately related to the source-sink relationship, quantified by the safety factor (SF). Moreover, the isoline where the SF dropped below unity matched the area where propagation failed. It was concluded that the mismatch of the source-sink relationship, rather than solely refractoriness, was the ultimate cause of the UDB leading to reentry. The SF represents a very powerful tool to study the mechanisms responsible for reentry.},

abstract = {Recent evidence supports the idea that robust and, importantly, FLEXIBLE automaticity of cardiac pacemaker cells is conferred by a coupled system of membrane ion currents (an "M-clock") and a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) oscillator ("Ca(2+)clock") that generates spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) releases. This study identified numerical models of a human biological pacemaker that features robust and flexible automaticity generated by a minimal set of electrogenic proteins and a Ca(2+)clock. Following the Occam's razor principle (principle of parsimony), M-clock components of unknown molecular origin were excluded from Maltsev-Lakatta pacemaker cell model and thirteen different model types of only 4 or 5 components were derived and explored by a parametric sensitivity analysis. The extended ranges of SR Ca(2+) pumping (i.e. Ca(2+)clock performance) and conductance of ion currents were sampled, yielding a large variety of parameter combination, i.e. specific model sets. We tested each set's ability to simulate autonomic modulation of human heart rate (minimum rate of 50 to 70bpm; maximum rate of 140 to 210bpm) in response to stimulation of cholinergic and $\beta$-adrenergic receptors. We found that only those models that include a Ca(2+)clock (including the minimal 4-parameter model "ICaL+IKr+INCX+Ca(2+)clock") were able to reproduce the full range of autonomic modulation. Inclusion of If or ICaT decreased the flexibility, but increased the robustness of the models (a relatively larger number of sets did not fail during testing). The new models comprised of components with clear molecular identity (i.e. lacking IbNa \& Ist) portray a more realistic pacemaking: A smaller Na(+) influx is expected to demand less energy for Na(+) extrusion. The new large database of the reduced coupled-clock numerical models may serve as a useful tool for the design of biological pacemakers. It will also provide a conceptual basis for a general theory of robust, flexible, and energy-efficient pacemaking based on realistic components.},

@article{Rodriguez2006,
abstract = {Myocardial ischemia is one of the main causes of sudden cardiac death, with 80\% of victims suffering from coronary heart disease. In acute myocardial ischemia, the obstruction of coronary flow leads to the interruption of oxygen flow, glucose, and washout in the affected tissue. Cellular metabolism is impaired and severe electrophysiological changes in ionic currents and concentrations ensue, which favor the development of lethal cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation. Due to the burden imposed by ischemia in our societies, a large body of research has attempted to unravel the mechanisms of initiation, sustenance, and termination of cardiac arrhythmias in acute ischemia, but the rapidity and complexity of ischemia-induced changes as well as the limitations in current experimental techniques have hampered evaluation of ischemia-induced alterations in cardiac electrical activity and understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Over the last decade, computer simulations have demonstrated the ability to provide insight, with high spatiotemporal resolution, into ischemic abnormalities in cardiac electrophysiological behavior from the ionic channel to the whole organ. This article aims to review and summarize the results of these studies and to emphasize the role of computer simulations in improving the understanding of ischemia-related arrhythmias and how to efficiently terminate them.},

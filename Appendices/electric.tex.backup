 This appendix gives greater detail about the ionic movement theories, and electric theory properties generally, of the modelling of electrically active cells---note that this applies equally well to both cardiac cells and to neurons.

 \section{Diffusion of ions}
 \label{sec:ion-diffusion}
 By simple diffusion, there is a net movement of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low diffusion with simple thermal movement. This movement is according to Fick's Law,
 \begin{equation}
  F_X = -D\frac{\partial C_X}{\partial x},
 \end{equation}
 where $F_X$ and $C_X$ represent the flux and concentration of particle $X$ respectively, and $D$ represents the diffusion coefficient. It should be noted that this represents \emph{net} diffusion: there will be movement of particles in both directions. For circumstances where $D$ is constant, this solves to produce
 \begin{equation}
  F_X = P(C_{X,o}-C_{X,i}),
 \end{equation}
 where $P$ represents the permeability of the membrane, and is equivalent to \nicefrac{D}{d}, where $d$ represents the thickness of the membrane. $C_{X,o}$ and $C_{x,i}$ represent the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of $X$, respectively; thus $F_X$ in this form describes flux from the extra- to the intracellular space. It can be noted that for substances that diffuse through the lipid phase of the membrane, the permeability also depends on the oil/water partition coefficient $\beta$: $P = \beta$\nicefrac{D}{d}.

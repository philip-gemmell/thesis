 \emph{The rationale for using parameter space variation as a means to model physiological variation is presented. An examination of the efficacy of various different commonly used biomakers is presented, with a view to determining which biomarkers are most suited to identify AP goodness-of-fit under conditions that may include experimental noise. The results of parameter variation for two separate computational model frameworks are explored, and models that reproduce experimentally observed variation are isolated, with patterns amongst the parameters that contribute to these populations being discussed.}

\section{Reproduction of Experimental Variation}
\label{sec:paramSpace-rationale}
As was elaborated on in \S\ref{sec:param-var}, variation is a constant companion in the experimentalist's world. As computational models of biological processes become more complex, with advancing technology allowing us to discard earlier assumptions made for the sake of computational tractability, and further advances in experimental results allow greater understanding of the system being modelled, variation is now increasingly becoming the computational modeller's companion as well. It is to be noted that this variability includes the so-called experimental variation, the `noise' that can get in the way of the `true' data, but also includes the variation that is a normal, and perhaps essential, component of physiological symptoms.

However, exactly \emph{how} this variation is to be modelled is a question left to the modeller---there are many possible alternatives. Which of these alterantives is to be used depends on the exact question being asked: what system is being modelled, how its output is being assessed, and so forth. It depends further on the available resources, and the demands being made of those resources. Were resources and capabilities infinite and on demand, a fully stochastic, molecular model, subject to multiple simulations, would accurately and precisely model the system---indeed, for all intents and purposes, it would \emph{be} the system. However, not only are resources finite, such a model would be drastic overkill for most research questions regarding cardiac physiology. Instead, much like the research question being posed drives the model choice, it also drives the methodology for reproduction of variability, if it is required---it should be as complex as required, but it need not be any more so.

It is the main drive of this thesis to demonstrate a method for reproducing the observed experimental variation that is
\begin{itemize}
 \item biophysically detailed,
 \item computationally tractable, and
 \item easily scalable.
\end{itemize}
To this end, we utilise the population level approach used previously in neuron modelling \citep{Marder2011}. As compared to stochastic simulations, such a methodology is computationally simpler---due to their complexity and the requirement for multiple simulations for their statistical properties to be refined, stochastic models are often limited to phenomenological, small scale models. This thus ties in to the other advantage of the model population approach: the biophysical detail that can be applied via such a process. In prescribing variation to certain biophysically specific properties, and observing the consequences, specific output variation effects can be attributed to specific input variation effects. It should be noted, however, that \citet{Heijman2013} recently demonstrated the feasibility of using a biophysically-detailed stochastic model, although it is still restricted to small-scale simulations.

Using parallelisation available by means of the Nimrod/G distributed computing grid and its various alternatives, a population model approach is also computationally tractable---each individual simulation can be computationally simple, and correct distribution can ensure that non-specialised computing resources are sufficient to the task. Finally, it is also easily scalable. By this, it is meant that not only is it a simple process to introduce variation to further parameters of interest, but also that the methodology is trivially applicable to multiple models (indeed, this thesis is based on investigations using two different models).

Moreover, it should be noted that the complete, multi-dimensional parameter sweep method used here provides significant advantages over other possible methods, both for analysis of the effects of parameter variation and for the generation of model populations. For the purposes of comparison, we may consider four alternative methods:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Stochastic Models \citep{Heijman2013} \label{list:stochastic}
 \item Single dimensional parameter variation \citet{Romero2009, Romero2011, Romero2010}, \label{list:single-param}
 \item Sampling from the multi-dimensional parameter space \citep{Britton2013}, \label{list:multi-sample}
 \item Multi-variable regression analysis \citep{Sobie2009, Sobie2011, Sarkar2010, Sarkar2011}, \label{list:multi-variate}
\end{enumerate}
The advantage of the population approach over \ref{list:stochastic} has already been stated, in that, by and large, stochastic models are far less computationally tractable, especially for large simulations; it is currently impractical to conduct a stochastic tissue-scale simulation while still using a biophysically detailed model. The other three methods are all far more computationally tractable, but all, by and large, do not share the advantage presented by model populations of detailed biophysical insight into parameter interactions.

%%% REREAD SOBIE AND SARKAR PAPERS TO MAKE SURE CRITICISMS ARE FOUNDED
%%% CHECK HEJTMANN(?) PAPER FOR STOCHASTIC PROGRESS

% Population production versus variation analysis: populations not possible with single param variation.
% Sampling for parameter space does not allow trends to be seen
% Sobie method reduces multiple parameter variation to single parameter (with great accuracy) - does not allow trends/correlations to be seen (especially when multiple parameters are involved, e.g. X and Y are correlated when Z is this, but changes when Z is this.
% Sobie method, by reducing to single parameter variation, is poorly suited to application to novel situations, as the parameter space defined by the method (by being reduced to single param) may be inextricably linked to initial, training conditions.
% Sampling from param space does not allow full picture of variation to be seen

\subsection{Important Caveats}
\label{subsec:caveats}
It should be noted that, replacing a parameter set with a parameter space, in effect constructing a population of models based on a single framework, allows for a biophysically realistic method of reproducing physiological variation which remains computationally tractable. However, there are several key points that must be remembered that represent the limitations of this, and many related, approach.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The underlying assumptions regarding the original model still apply. As such, any inaccurate assumptions remain present in derived populations \citet{Noble2001, Quinn2013}.
 \item The populations derived using experimental data rely on these data remaining appropriate for the considered task. The populations used in this thesis are derived using `healthy' data. As such, without further adaptation, the populations are unsuitable for assessing some experimental situations, \eg{} where cardiac remodelling has occurred \citep{Walmsley2013}.
 \item Related to the point above is the fact that the model populations are united by the data used to create them. As such, if the data used include such differences as gender, the models cannot then be used to address specific questions regarding gender.
\end{enumerate}

% Comment on differences between AP and Ca biomarkers and relative importances and whatnot - compare to conclusions in Walmsely2013

% Warn of effects of tissue level effects (Heijman2013) - we are contructing cell populations using tissue data. Due to cell coupling, actual population could be a lot larger, but it is beyond the scope of this thesis to address the effect of cell coupling on the cell population (rigorously defining a new cell population would require immense computational effort, though it is perhaps an interestng future avenue to examine the implications on a more general basis to determine the possible effects).

\section{Constructing the Model Population}
\label{sec:paramSpace-methods}
Fitting over several pacing rates is not simply a method to include more data in the fitting process (itself a laudable goal)---previous work has demonstrated that, for the AP restitution curve to be accurately fitted, data from several pacing rates must be included \citep{Syed2005}
% Not actually checking the restitution curve! Expand upon this point, though
\begin{itemize}
 \item Rationale for varying only conductances: (i) assume that AP variability is mostly the product of such variation (ii) conductance parameters are the most poorly defined parameters within a computational model, and thus they represent the source of the greatest uncertainty within the model.
 \item Why these conductances? Due to expected effect on repolarisation
 \item Rationale for $\pm30\%$ variation (also refer back to LitReview):
 \begin{description}
  \item Wanted to achieve balance between breadth of sweep and detail. While computational models have used large variation, the same extent of variation is not seen experimentally.
  \item[\citet{Romero2009}] Previously used $\pm30\%$
  \item[\citet{Fink2008}] $\pm8.57\%$, computational value
  \item[\citet{Fulop2004}] Experimental data for \ica{}: time constant for recovery $\pm3.39\%$, density of peak \ica{} $\pm7/27\%$, time constant of inactivation $\pm4.10\%$, $\pm5.56\%$
  \item[\citet{Iost1998}] Variation of time constants: $\pm23.87\%$, $\pm8.98\%$, $\pm12.89\%$, $\pm16.6\%$, $\pm17.79\%$
  \item[\citet{Li1999}] Peak \ica{}(0.5 Hz): $\pm8.93\%$; Plateau \ica{}(0.5 Hz): $\pm17.6\%$; Peak \ica{}(2 Hz): $\pm8.1\%$; Plateau \ica{}(2 Hz): $\pm18.2\%$
  \item[\citet{Szentadrassy2005}] See Table \ref{table:szentadrassy-results}
  \item[\citet{Verkerk2005}] Female ventricular myocyte density = 129$\%$ male. Quasi-steady steate current (male) is $2.8\pm0.6$ pApF$^{-1}$, (female) is\ldots{}

\section{Effects of Parameter Variation}
\label{sec:param-effects}
Use dimensional stack images, etc., to explore the effect of variation of parameters within the explored parameter space. Highlight the effects demonstrated by just dimensional stacks, \eg{} relations between parameters being varied.

% Compare results of effects of variation with results of Heijman2013 (I(Na) and I(Kr) are most influential for affecting BVR, followed by I(Ks)). Pumps and exchangers with low throughput but high expression number had little effect (large numbers wiped out stochastic effects). Also I(NaK) and I(NaCa) using Sobie method - this implies effects mediated via ion concentrations and the like, and these do not affect BVR directly.

% Heijman2013 says AP morphology important for BVR (longer plateau => greater BVR). Tie in to choice of parameters.

% Heijman2013 also says BVR increases with CL - compare to results?

\section{Defining a Population of Models to Reproduce Physiological Variation}
\label{sec:population}
Brief outline of following sections.

\subsection{Accuracy of Biomarkers in Defining Model Fit}
\label{subsec:biomarker-accuracy}
Define different biomarkers to be tested, paying particular attention to NRMSD metrics. Present comparison between them

One of the goals of this thesis is to measure the efficacy of the above biomarkers in assessing goodness-of-fit for populations, \idest{} in a situation where \emph{populations} are being compared, which biomarkers provide the most accurate measure of how well a particular model fits given training data. With a parameter sweep providing a population of models, and thus a population of data, that free from experimental noise, this provides an opportunity for such an assessment. Without having to consider the problems of experimental noise, the entire range of recorded data can be used to assess the extent of how well the model matches training data.

\subsection{Variation within the Population}
\label{subsec:population-trends}
Explain how population is defined (using APD90 and APD50, and how those ranges are arrived at). Present data for which models are accepted as fitting experimental data, and what trends are evident in these populations, \eg{} which parameters are coupled and whatnot. Mention connectivity of parameter space.

% Variation in V_rest is poorly modelled, but we weren't looking at modelling that anyway...

% Mention how original parameter sets are not included in the population. Compare this to Sato2009, where different parameters had to be used to reproduce experimental data re: EAD formation

\subsection{Connectivity within the Parameter Space}
\label{subsec:space-connectivity}
